		<English>[TAB]The ancient Letts, or "Latgalians" (i.e. inhabitants of the primal Latgale, – this ancient Central-Baltic term derives very likely from *Lætgale = "The Lettland"; compare with *Zemgale = "The lower-land"), were a Central Baltic tribe of little-known origin, which dwell in the 5th-6th centuries only in the Eastern part of present-day Vidzeme (westwards from Aiviekste River), and later on – in the nearly all territory of that region. In written sources, they are mentioned from the 11th century. In the first two decades of the 13th century, the (Western) Latgalians allied with German (mainly Saxon) crusaders and their lands were incorporated into Livonia  at unknown conditions. In the 13th-14th centuries, they assimilated in nowaday Latgale an unknown East-Baltic tribe, the latter this way becoming part of ethnic Latvians (it's accentuating, that the Latvian term latgalieši ("Latgalians"), in sense "Eastern Latvians", dates only to the early 20th century).</English>
