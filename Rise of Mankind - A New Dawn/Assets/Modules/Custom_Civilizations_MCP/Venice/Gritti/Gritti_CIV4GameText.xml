		<English>[H1]Andrea Gritti[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Doge of Venice[NEWLINE]Lived: [\BOLD] 1455 - 1538[NEWLINE]Gritti was born in Bardolino, near Verona. He spent much of his early life in Constantinople, looking after Venetian interests. In 1499, he was imprisoned on charges of espionage, but escaped execution due to his friendship with the vizier, and was released several years later.  Elected Doge in 1523, Gritti concluded a treaty with Charles V, ending Venice's active involvement in the Italian Wars. He attempted to maintain the neutrality of the Republic in the face of the continued struggle between Charles and Francis, urging both to turn their attention to the advances of the Ottoman Empire in Hungary. However, he could not prevent Suleiman I from attacking Corfu in 1537, drawing Venice into a war with the Ottomans. He died in 1538.
