		<English>[TAB]The music of Nigeria includes many kinds of folk and popular music, some of which are known worldwide. Styles of folk music are related to the multitudes of ethnic groups in the country, each with their own techniques, instruments, and songs. JuJu is a style of Nigerian popular music, derived from traditional Yoruba percussion. This music, unlike apala, sakara, and fuji, was not created by Muslim Yoruba, and is therefore secular. JuJu music is performed primarily by artists from the southwestern region of Nigeria, where the Yoruba are the most numerous ethnic group. In performance, audience members commonly shower JuJu musicians with paper money; this tradition is known as "spraying."</English>
