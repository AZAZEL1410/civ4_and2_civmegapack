How to generate a full installer ?

Requirements:
- NSIS Unicode (latest known is 2.46.5) must be installed (reboot after install). The setup is available in the main mod repository "installer/NSIS_unicode_setup".
- NSIS plugin "nsis_zipdll_plugin_unicode" content should be copied into the the NSIS unicode setup directory.

Usage (Without updating translations):
Right-click on "mcp_full_installer_script.nsi" and select "Compile Unicode NSIS Script". It will set the revision number to the current revision of the repository and start the generation of the installer named "rand_mcp_full_installer_${DATE}_${REVISION}.exe".
Once done, you can either "Test installer" to launch it or close the window. The installer executable should appear next the to script file.

Usage (With a translation update):
- First, it is needed to initialize transifex on your PC before to be able to download latest translations. Please read the read-me in the folder "Translations".
- Once done, double-click on "Update installer translations.bat". It will download the latest installer translation and inject those into the installer script (full_installer_script.nsi).
- Then, just Right-click on "mcp_full_installer_script.nsi", select "Compile Unicode NSIS Script" and wait for the installer to be generated.

Some notes:
- The script strongly relies on the folder structure of the repository as it will pick icons and build number directly into the mod folder.
- The most important part to generate a build is the line 60 “; Language” which lists the enabled languages. All the translations are directly included in the files starting at line 99 “; Translations”.
Some of these lines are commented because the languages are not enabled yet (only partial or no translation yet). Uncomment the language line once it is enough translated for public release.
