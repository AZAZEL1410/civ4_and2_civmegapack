There are two versions of the model and four versions of the texture available. Textures are more or less interchangable.
Simply rename texture or edit nif via nifskope.

To save vertices and polygons, you could remove the well at the middle via nifskope.

models:
vegvar2.nif - original model made by me (cool3a2)
vegvar.nif - optimized by hrochland (thanks a lot!), default

textures
vegvar_bright.dds - original texture generated out of the google warehouse art
vegvar_bright256.dds - a 256x256 pixel, thus low res, version of the previous texture
vegvar.dds - altered version by avain (thanks avain!), optimized by me - a bit too detailed but good as base for further work...
vegvar256.dds - a low res version of the previous texture (256x256 pixels) with additional tricks to the roof, default
