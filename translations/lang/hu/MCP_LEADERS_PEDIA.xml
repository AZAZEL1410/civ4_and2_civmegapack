  <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_SANTA_ANNA_PEDIA">[H1]Antonio López de Santa Anna[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Mexico (11 times).[\BOLD][NEWLINE]Santa Annas normal loyalty would be to ally with the wealthy and privileged, but his immediate concern was to be on the winning side in any battle. Switching allegiance never troubled him. Santa Anna declared himself retired, \"unless my country needs me\". He decided he was needed when Anastasio Bustamante led a coup, overthrowing and killing President Vicente Guerrero. Santa Anna was elected president in 1833.Gómez Farías did many reforms, introducing antimilitary and anticlergical reforms. He reduced the size of the army and worked hard to root out corruption in the military. He also changed some rules reflecting the power of the Church. Clergymen would be allowed to preach only for religious matters. He altered the education as a fully secular system. The mandatory tax for the support of the Church was abolished. These drastic reforms angered many of the powerful among the military, wealthy landowners, and the Catholic Church. When there was rebellion and violence against the reform that Farias had made, Santa Anna changed his side, again. Santa Anna reversed his support for the liberals and joined the conservatives, dismissed Farías, declared the Constitution suspended, disbanded the Congress, and worked to concentrate power in the central government. This was applauded by some conservatives, but met with considerable disapproval from other sectors. He established a Catholic, centralist dictatorship and replaced the Constitution of 1824(the one that Farias established), with a new document, called The Seven Laws.  the Constitution of 1836. The regime was a centralized dictatorship led by the military.Several states went into open rebellion: Coahuila y Tejas, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro, Durango, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Yucatán, Jalisco, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas and Zacatecas. Several of these states formed their own governments, the Republic of the Rio Grande, the Republic of Yucatan, and the Republic of Texas. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. They and their allies from the United States declared independence from Mexico. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies.The Zacatecan militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by Francisco Garcia, was well armed with .753 caliber British \'Brown Bess\' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. After two hours of combat, on 12 May 1835, the Santa Anna\'s \"Army of Operations\" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to ransack Zacatecas for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas.</string>
