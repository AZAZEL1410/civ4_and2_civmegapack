 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ABORIGINES_PEDIA">[TAB]It is believed that first human migration to Australia was achieved when this landmass earlier formed part of the Sahul continent, connected to the island of New Guinea via a land bridge. It is also possible that people came by boat across the Timor Sea. The exact timing of the arrival of the ancestors of the Indigenous Australians has been a matter of dispute among archaeologists. The most conservative widely-accepted timeline for first arrival is between 40,000 - 50,000 years BP. This means there have been more than 1250 generations in Australia. A 48,000 BC date is based on a few sites in northern Australia dated using thermoluminescence. A large number of sites have been radiocarbon dated to around 38,000 BC, leading some researchers to doubt the accuracy of the thermoluminescence technique. Some estimates have been given as wide as from 30,000 to 68,000 BC.[PARAGRAPH:2]There is no clear or accepted racial origin of the indigenous people of Australia. Although they migrated to Australia through Southeast Asia they are not related to any known Asian population. Nor are they related to the nearby peoples of Melanesia or Polynesia. There is some speculation that they are related to some racial groups in India, based on mitochondrial DNA evidence. In view of the very long time they have been in Australia, almost entirely isolated from other human populations, it is unlikely that they will be found to be closely related to any identifiable racial group.[PARAGRAPH:2]The term \"Indigenous Australians\" encompasses a large number of diverse communities and societies, with notably different modes of subsistence, cultural practices, languages, technologies and inhabited environments. However, these peoples also share a larger set of traits, and are otherwise seen as being broadly related. A collective identity as Indigenous Australians is recognised and exists alongside the identity and membership of many local community and traditional groups.[PARAGRAPH:2]The word aboriginal, appearing in English since at least the 17th century and meaning \"first or earliest known, indigenous,\" has been used in Australia to describe its indigenous peoples as early as 1789. (The word aborigines was used first in Latin to denote the \"original\" inhabitants of the settlement that later became Rome after the advent of refugees from Troy, with whom they later intermarried: see Livy, History of Rome, 1.) It soon became capitalised and employed as the common name to refer to all Indigenous Australians. Strictly speaking, \"Aborigine\" is the noun and \"Aboriginal\" the adjectival form; however this latter is often also employed to stand as a noun. Note that the use of \"Aboriginal(s)\" in this sense, i.e. as a noun, has acquired negative, even derogatory connotations among some sectors of the community, who regard it as insensitive, and even offensive. The more acceptable and correct expression is \"Australian Aborigines,\" though even this is sometimes regarded as an expression to be avoided because of its historical associations with colonialism. \"Indigenous Australians\" has found increasing acceptance, particularly since the 1980s.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Australian Aboriginal population is for the most part urbanised, but a substantial number live in settlements (often located on the site of former church missions) in what are considered remote areas. The health and economic difficulties facing both groups are substantial. Aboriginal people, particularly youths, are substantially more likely to be imprisoned than the general population, and the rate of suicides in police custody remains quite high. Rates of unemployment, health problems and poverty are likewise higher than the general population; and school retention rate and university attendance is lower. Before the British colonisation, there were a great many different Aboriginal groups, each with their own individual culture, belief structure, and language (approximately 300 different languages existed at the time of European settlement). These cultures overlapped to a greater or lesser extent, and evolved over time. Indigenous Australian Aboriginal communities are often called tribes, and there are several hundred in Australia, although the exact number is unknown, because in many parts of Australia, there are no clear tribes or nations. The word 'community' is often used to describe Aboriginal groups as a more acceptable word. Sometimes smaller communities are referred to as tribes, and other times many communities are included in the same 'tribe'. Sometimes the different language groups are called tribes, although it can be very difficult to distinguish between different languages and dialects of a single language. The situation is complicated by the fact that sometimes up to twenty or thirty different names (either spelled differently in English, or using a different word altogether) are used for the same tribe or community. The largest Aboriginal communities today are the Pitjantjatjara, the Arrernte, the Luritja and the Warlpiri, all from the Northern Territory.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_AKKADIAN_PEDIA">[TAB]The rise of the Akkadian Empire marked the first time in history that the entire region of Mesopotamia was united under one ruler, the king of Agade (Akkad). The conquests of these kings of Akkad marked a break with the previous Sumerian Early Dynastic period; however, the culture of the region under the Akkadian rulers did not differ much from that of their Sumerian predecessors. The main difference was that of the language of the ruling authority: the Akkadians replaced the Sumerian language with their Semitic language. Indeed, because the two civilizations were in very close contact for centuries and their languages borrowed many words from each other, it is difficult to distinguish the two during their coexistence in the Early Dynastic period, before the Akkadians consolidated their power over Sumer.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sargon, the first ruler of the dynasty of Agade, came to power in 2334 BC and expanded his rule over the cities of Mesopotamia, conquering the Sumerians. The Akkadians also campaigned quite far to the east and west - by their own accounts, all the way to the Mediterranean. These large military conquests marked a shift from the parochial ruling style of the Sumerians.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many remarkable artifacts have been recovered from the Akkadian empire, including a 160 kilogram piece of a solid copper statue of a male figure and a life-size copper head, likely a representation of the king Naram-Sin. Both pieces show naturalism and fine workmanship. The most famous Akkadian artifact is Naram-Sin's Victory Stele, recording his victory over the Lullubi tribe in western Iran.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Akkadian Empire began to collapse under pressure from neighboring tribes during the reign of Shar-kali-sharri (r.2217-2193). According to the Sumerian King List, the empire deteriorated into a state of anarchy after his reign:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]\"Who was king? Was Nanum king? Was Imi king? Was Elulu king? The four of[NEWLINE][TAB][TAB]them were kings and reigned three years.\"[PARAGRAPH:2]The last kings of Agade were Dudu and Shu-durul. By the time of their reigns, the city states to the south, including Lagash, had gained their independence, and the empire had been reduced to the region just around Agade.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ALBANIA_PEDIA">[TAB]Albania is experienced by Civilization standards; home to the ancient Illyrians, the first people in the Balkans, Albania has housed the most ancient surviving race in Europe.  The Albanians, like their Illyrian ancestors, lived primarily in tribal and clan structures.  Rival clans competed with each other for much of their existance, resulting in disunity amongst the tribes, which fell victim to 33 armed invasions.  The central theme of Albania's history is that of the struggle and suffering of a fiercely independent but hopelessly outnumbered people against the tide of conquest in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2] The term \"Albanian\" was first mentioned in a document by a Byzantine emperor in 1081.  This generic name classified all remaining Illyrians by the name of a single tribe, the Albani, situated in central Albania.  It was the Illyrians in the southern part of the Balkans which averted assimilation from the Slavic invaders that their north Balkan counterparts fell victim to.  Beginning with these invasions was the start of tensions between the Albanians and the Slavs, which have been at war with each other throughout much of their respective histories.[PARAGRAPH:2] Albania's Golden Age occurred in 1443 with the inception of the rebellion of Gjergj Kastrioti, the military strategist that managed to secure support from Christian Europe in continually defeating the Ottoman Empire in battle.  His success lay not only in the genius that he possessed, but also in the unity of the Albanians: Gjergj Kastrioti was the only man in Albania's history to completely unite the Albanian tribes.  Under the battle cry of a united, independent Albania, Gjergj Kastrioti waged a Holy War against the Muslim Turks with the ancient Albanian ideals of \"Nation, Faith, Fatherland!\"  They defeated the most powerful army in the world for 25 years until his death in 1468.  The Albanians continued their struggle under the leadership of Leke Dukagjini, but without the father of their nation they digressed into their former tribal alliegances.  The last Albanian fortress fell by 1480, and Albania was plunged into a dark age of Ottoman occupation.[PARAGRAPH:2] The Catholic Albanians initially resisted Turkish rule and sporadic revolts took place until the Turks adopted a policy of Islamicization, converting roughly 2/3 of the population to Islam over time.  This fostered even further disunity amongst the Albanians by adding a religious element of separation.  Albanian Muslims became subservient to Turkish authority and rose to positions of power and influence within the Empire.  Catholic Albanians maintained their centers of resistance, namely the mountainous Northern Highlands, and resisted Turkish rule with force.  The intelligentsia was murdered and the citizens were culturally and economically supressed.  For nearly 5 centuries the Albanians were stifled under the occupation of the Ottoman Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2] It was not until the Rilindja period in the late 19th century that nationalism prevailed over all else for the Albanians, like in the days of Gjergj Kastrioti.  The rebirth of Albanian culture and nationalism was jumpstarted by the treaty of San Stefano, a result of the Russo-Turkish war, which the Russians imposed on the Turks, forcing them to give Albanian lands to the Slavic countries of the Balkans.  The League of Prizren was formed in Kosova to combat this proposed partitioning of Albanian land to Montenegro, Serbia, and Bulgaria.  During this time Albanians began to put aside their religious and regional differences to come together to defend the land of their ancestors.  Austria-Hungary and the United Kingdom called a European conference to discuss the provisions of the Treaty of San Stefano, for they feared a Russian presence in the Balkans (through the land assigned to its Slavic brothers) would upset the European balance of power.  The Congress of Berlin (1878) decreed that Montenegro, Serbia, and Greece were to be awarded large tracts of Albanian inhabited lands.  The League of Prizren assembled troops in defense of this partitioned land, and largely succeeded in its defense, until both the Great Powers of Europe and the Ottoman Empire combined forces to defeat the Albanians and hand over the partitioned territories.  Revolts once again rose up but were of little consequence until the turn of the 20th century.[PARAGRAPH:2] On April 6, 1911, the Albanian flag was raised by Ded Gjon Luli Dedvukaj to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire for the first time in 468 years.  The Albanians had once again managed to come together for the greater good in ridding their ancestral homeland of foreign occupiers.  This revolt sparked a general rebellion all throughout Albanian inhabited lands.  In 1912 Albanians took the Turkish-held capital of the vilayet of Kosova, Shkup, and Albanians in other areas defeated Turkish armies to reclaim their lands.  Neighboring Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to gain land, and Montenegro began the first Balkan War, along with Serbs, Bulgarians, and Greeks, to grab as much Albanian land as possible.  The Slavs took much of northern Albania, and the Greeks took large parts of southern Albania.  The Albanians quickly declared the independence of the Albanian state in the southern port city of Vlora (Valona) on November 28, 1912.  By 1913, the Treaty of Bucharest established that Albania was an independent country, albeit at half it's original size.[PARAGRAPH:2] The remainder of the 20th century saw two World Wars, hostility and border disputes, a harsh and cruel communist regime by a Stalin-like dictator, Enver Hoxha, then finally the emergence of democracy with Sali Berisha, and genocide against the Albanians of Kosova.  The story of Albania is a tragedy that is almost unknown throughout the world.  Yet, the people carry on with high hopes, despite their setting at the heart of the \"powderkeg of the Balkans,\" which can only be neutralized by restoring Albania to its pre-Congress of Berlin ethnic borders.  Hopefully such wrongs will be reversed, and Albania will finally be able to live peacefully with its neighbors.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ANGLO_SAXON_PEDIA">The Anglo-Saxon settlement of England was no overnight affair. The late-Roman army had many Germanic elements and from the fourth century they and their families had settled in Britain. It is, therefore, not surprising that after the withdrawal of the legions at the beginning of the fifth century individual towns looked to Germanic mercenaries to maintain their security. Vortigern, the post-Roman Kentish king, is often left to take the blame, but he was no doubt only one of several leaders who took this course. The fifth and sixth centuries saw increased Germanic settlement although the balance of local power fluctuated between Britons and Saxons. Ultimately, even in areas such as Northumbria, where Germanic settlement was sparse, the English language became the predominant one and the celtic language and lifestyles became marginalised to Wales, Cornwall and northern Scotland. The end of the sixth century saw another major new influence on the Germanic invaders - Christianity. Although the Romano-British Church survived and the Anglo-Saxons would have had contact with indigenous Christians, the Church initially existed only on the fringes of English settlement, as paganism remained strong. In 597 a Christian mission sent by Pope Gregory the Great and led by Augustine landed in Kent. Its initial success was dramatic. The prompt conversion of King Aethelberht of Kent (?560 - 616) and the kings of Essex and East Anglia, then the baptism of Aethelberht's son-in-law King Edwin of Northumbria (617 - 33) by his bride's Roman chaplain Paulinus established Christianity within the highest eschelons of English society. Sees were established at Canterbury, Rochester, London and York.The four kingdoms soon relapsed into paganism, and initially only Kent was reconverted. The evangelistic initiative passed to the Scottish church based on Iona, founded by the Irishman, Columba, in 563. King Oswald of Northumbria (634 - 42) was converted while in exile among the Scots and invited Iona to send him a mission: the result was Aidan's foundation of Lindisfarne in 635. The Irish bishops of Lindisfarne consolidated Christianity in Northumbria; their fellow countrymen Duima and Ceollach, and their English pupils, Cedd and Trumhere, re-established the religion in Essex and introduced it to Mercia and the Middle Angles, whose king, Penda (?610-55), was the last great pagan ruler. In none of these kingdoms was there any significant relapse but Iona was out of line with Rome on the methods of calculating the date of Easter. In 663 Bishop Colman was defeated on the issue at the Synod of Whitby and withdrew to Iona, leaving the way clear for the organisation of the English Church by Theodore of Canterbury (669 - 90). Although the Church of Iona found favour with some of the later kings it was generally the Roman church that was dominant.Of the seven Saxon Kingdoms (the Heptarchy), the first one to achieve supremacy was Northumbria, whose high culture during the seventh century is reflected in such works as the Lindisfarne Gospels. They ruled the whole area between Derby and Edinburgh and their central territories of Yorkshire and Northumberland remained independent until the Vikings took York in 866, whilst the lordship of Bamburgh continued as an Anglian enclave throughout the tenth century.The eighth century saw the rise of Mercia who pushed back the Northumbrians and West Saxons and took control of East Anglia and Kent. The peak of Mercian domination came under Offa (died 796), though it remained a potent force until the abdication of Burgred in 874.The year 793 marked a major change for England with the first major raid by Vikings on the Northumbrian monastery at Lindisfarne (although there is evidence of a small raid four years earlier in Devon). The next decade saw major raids along most of the southern and eastern coasts of England. Most of the raiders were Danes, but the common tongue of the Scandinavians enabled them all to work together. Remember, specific references to Danes and Norsemen are to be treated with caution.The first part of the ninth century saw the Vikings concentrating on Ireland and the north and west of England and Scotland, until 835 when the Danes began a series of major raids on the whole of England. These culminated in the 'Great Army' of 865 which wintered on the Isle of Thanet before commencing on a twelve year campaign ranging from Exeter to Dumbarton. This finally ended in an agreement with the West Saxon king which left them in control of half of the country.The house of Wessex also began its rise during the ninth century, commencing with Egbert who defeated the Mercians in 825 (it is ironic that the founder of the West Saxon fortunes actually ruled Sussex, Essex and Kent and based his mint at Canterbury!). It is noteworthy that his son, Æthelwold, was the first king of Wessex to inherit the throne from his father since the seventh century. Æthelwold's four sons succeeded him in turn and the youngest, Alfred, eventually fought the Vikings to a standstill at Edington which produced the Treaty of Wedmore in 878. This led to an uneasy peace and the establishment of the Danelaw.The early tenth century saw Norse encroachment from Ireland and the Western Isles into Cumbria, Lancashire and the Wirral peninsular. The rulers of Dublin were anxious to dominate York and the North, but the incoming Vikings were as much a threat to the now settled Danelaw as they were to Wessex. Athelstan achieved a decisive victory for Wessex at Brunanburgh in 937, when a coalition of Irish, Norse, Scots and Northumbrians were defeated. Dublin continued to try to exert influence, and fighting continued sporadically until, under Eadred, Eric Bloodaxe was driven out of York and killed at Stainmoor in 954. With external threats temporarily removed king Edgar, who came to the throne in 959, spent the next 18 years trying to weld the formerly disparate states of Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia and Wessex into a single body.The king's chief agents in this process were the eoldermen. In the ninth century each eolderman had governed only a single shire, but in the tenth century a trusted eolderman could find himself in charge of several shires. Eventually unification was achieved to a strong enough degree that the House of Wessex was universally accepted as the rightful royal family. Weak though it was in some areas, the administration was strong enough to impose a uniform royal coinage on England, and to reap the financial advantage from the country's growing economic prosperity. At the end of the tenth century, when the Viking attacks came again, the prize at stake was nothing less than the 'Kingdom of the English'.During the reign of Æthelred (978 -1016) the Viking attacks on England started again. In the 980's Viking raids along the Welsh coast were extended to include south-west England. At the same time attacks on London and the south-east began from the North Sea and Scandinavia. The 990's saw the operation of great armies under the leadership of Olaf, later king of Norway, and Swein, king of Denmark.During this period of Viking attacks Æthelred's response was to appoint eoldermen to take control of important military areas. An attack on Essex in 991 was met by the local eolderman, Bryhtnoth, in an infamous encounter at Maldon. In 992 an English fleet assembled at London had some success against the Vikings. However, the time honoured methods of ransom, Danegeld and baptism of Viking leaders continued to be more successful. It has been estimated that between 990 and 1014 around 250,000 pounds (over 102 tons) of silver were paid in Danegeld to the Viking raiders in addition to food, livestock, etc., and any other wealth gained from raiding.The Viking onslaught came mainly from King Swein of Denmark. From 1003 to 1006, and again in 1013, Swein led devastating attacks on England, while Thorkell the Tall campaigned in the south and east between 1009 and 1013. In 1007 Æthelred ordered the burning of ships and recreated the large eoldermanry of Mercia for Eadric in an attempt to co-ordinate English defences. Unfortunately the fleet assembled at Sandwich in 1009 fell prey to bad weather and English efforts had little effect against Thorkell's determined campaign. This culminated in the capture and murder of Ælfheah, Archbishop of Canterbury. Swein came to England in August 1013 secure in the expectation of conquest. At Gainsborough he received the submission of Northumbria, Lindsey and the Five Boroughs; Oxford, Winchester and south-west England soon followed. Finally, towards the end of the year, the last resistance collapsed, Swein was recognised as king of England and Æthelred fled to Normandy.Swein died in 1014 after only a few months as king. The Viking fleet immediately proclaimed his son Cnut king, but the English councillors recalled Æthelred. In 1015 Æthelred's eldest son Edmund revolted against his father in an attempt to usurp the throne. This, coupled with the King's ill health and the enmity between Edmund and eolderman Eadric, divided the final stages of the English effort against the Danes.Æthelred died in 1016 and, in spite of Eadric's defection to Cnut, Edmund held Cnut to a military stalemate. The division of England, giving Edmund Wessex and Cnut the North, was nullified by Edmund's death in 1016 so the Viking Cnut was left to rule all England.Cnut's conquest of England laid the foundation of a Northern Empire. After his coronation in 1018 and his marriage to Emma, Æthelred's widow (a marriage which ensured the goodwill of her brother, the Duke of Normandy) Cnut's position as king was secured. About a year later he acquired the kingdom of Denmark after the death of his brother Harald.During this period many Danes settled in England and Cnut gave some of them senior positions of authority. It was at this time the English title 'eolderman' was replaced by the Danish influenced 'eorl', although this change of name did not mean any change in the nature of the office or the powers of its holder.Emma, Cnut's English wife was made regent of Norway for their eldest son Swein. Her reign was unpopular and even before Cnut's death she was driven out in favour of Magnus, Olaf's son. On the English side of the North Sea few of Cnut's Danish eorls outlasted the 1020's. At the end of his reign the kingdom was dominated by three eorls - an Englishman of the old aristocracy, Leofric of Mercia; an English newcomer, Godwin of Wessex, married to a Dane; and a Dane, Siward of Northumbria, married to an Englishwoman.Cnut's empire collapsed after his death (1035). The rebellion of Magnus of Norway led to prolonged war between Norway and Denmark, and this prevented Hardacnut, Cnut's chosen heir (and son of Emma), from crossing to England. In his absence his half-brother Harold was chosen, first as regent and later as king.After Harold's death in 1040 Hardacnut re-united the two kingdoms, but on his death in 1042 England reverted to the old West Saxon line. The short and troubled reigns of Cnut's sons saw the rise of powerful dynasties in England, most notably the family of Eorl Godwin. From obscure origins in Sussex, this family rose in two generations to the pinnacle of power in England. A turning point in the family's fortunes was the marriage in 1043 of Godwin's daughter Edith to King Edward the Confessor. The advancement of her kinsmen immediately followed; an eorldom was specially created for her eldest brother Swein, her second brother, Harold, became Eorl of East Anglia, and her cousin Beorn Estrithson received an eorldom in the east Midlands, apparently as Harold's subordinate.Although powerful the Godwinsons were not the only powerful Eorls, and in 1045 half of the country was still not under their control. In the north Eorl Siward was strong and held the Scots at bay. When he died the Scots launched many attacks against the new eorl Tostig, and later against Morcar. Swein Godwinson was the black sheep of his family and his wilder exploits - including the rape and abduction of the Abbess of Leominster and the murder of his cousin Beorn - led to his banishment in 1049, although he was later pardoned. Edward obviously resented his dependence upon Godwin and in 1051 the Eorl and his family were deprived of their titles and exiled, but the king had over-reached himself. In 1052 Godwin's family engineered a successful return, forcing the king to restore their land and titles.Godwin died in 1053 and was succeeded by his son Harold who became Eorl of Wessex, yielding his East Anglian eorldom to Ælfgar, son of Leofric of Mercia. In 1055, on the death of Siward, Tostig Godwinson, the third brother, became Eorl of Northumbria. When, in 1057, both Leofric of Mercia and Eorl Ralph of Hereford died, Harold added Hereford to the Eorldom of Wessex, Gyrth Godwinson succeeded Aelfgar in East Anglia, and Leofwine Godwinson received an eorldom in the East Midlands. From this time Harold was the real ruler of England. His campaigns against the Welsh, culminating in the conquest of north Wales, added to his prestige and he was described by contemporaries as Subregulus (underking) and Dux Anglorum.Edward was brought up in Normandy and during his reign many Normans came to England and gained important positions as advisors, church-men or military officers. In fact Edward seemed to favour foreigners unless they were Norse. During his reign much European culture was brought into the country. He was also responsible for a number of church reforms during this period.The death of Edward in January 1066 left England without an adult male representative of the royal line. William 'the Bastard', Duke of Normandy, claimed that Edward had promised him the kingdom as early as 1051. Harold Godwinson, Eorl of Wessex and for many years the king's right hand man, claimed that Edward had 'committed the kingdom' to him on his deathbed. The Scandinavian kings often fished in troubled waters such as this, as Harald Hardrada of Norway did in September 1066, followed by Swein Estrithson of Denmark after the Conquest. Another factor in the equation was Harold's brother Tostig, exiled in 1065, who attempted to regain his eorldom by force of arms. When Edward died William started to build a fleet and gather an army in Normandy. In England, Harold and his nobles stationed an army along the south coast and a fleet off the Isle of Wight. But Tostig was first off the mark, raiding the south coast until frightened off by Harold, and the east coast until Eorl Edwin defeated him in Lindsey. Tostig fled to Scotland where he sheltered until joining with Harald of Norway.Harold watched the Channel from May until September. If William had sailed when he had hoped to, he would have run into a warm reception and his invasion may well have been remembered as just another battle amongst the many that year. William was lucky; the direction of the prevailing wind kept his fleet bottled up in port until the provisions of the English forces had been exhausted. In September Harold disbanded the Fyrd and returned to London where he learned the Norwegians had landed in Yorkshire. Within two weeks he raised an army and force-marched it from London to York. Before he could arrive, Edwin and Morcar stood against Harald Hardrada at Gate Fulford, two miles south of York. Their defeat after a hard battle meant that the local Fyrd could play little part in the events that followed. This left the invaders free to march on York, where men of the shire agreed to help Harald in the conquest of England. Five days later King Harold attacked the Norwegians at their camp at Stamford Bridge, taking them by surprise. The battle raged all day, and by nightfall on the 25th September Harald Hardrada and Tostig lay dead and the shattered remains of their army were in full flight. Harold had defeated one of the foremost warriors of the age. Tradition has it that he was at a feast celebrating his victory when the news arrived that William had landed with his army at Pevensey on the morning of the 28th of September.Once more Harold was all energy; within 13 days he had completed the settlement of the restless north, marched 190 miles back to London, raised another army, and marched (rode on horseback like all his troops) a further 50 miles to a point within striking distance of Hastings where the Normans had established their base.Harold has been accused of 'reckless and impulsive haste', and most chroniclers agree that he fought with an army smaller than it need have been. We cannot be certain why he chose to fight when he did. It is possible he was trying to fight before it became known amongst his men that William bore a papal banner and to fight against him could mean excommunication. Alternatively, he may have sought to take William by surprise, a tactic which had worked three weeks before. Whatever his reason, the Norman scouts warned of the English approach on the morning of the 14th of October, and it was the English who were taken by surprise.It is generally said that each army numbered about 7,000 men, but the figures may have been lower. The English probably deployed about 4,000 Thegns and Huscarls, and 2 - 3,000 fyrdsmen recruited on the march through the home counties. The Normans fielded perhaps 5,000 infantry, including archers, and up to 2,000 knights.The English took up position on a ridge near Hastings and waited for the Normans to make their move. The Huscarls probably formed the front rank with the lighter armed Fyrdsmen behind them. The Normans made several attacks all of which were repulsed. William tried to use his archers to break the shield wall but they were ineffective, and the battle became a war of attrition. The Norman's lucky break came when their Breton cavalry were routed at the same time as a rumour that William had been killed spread amongst both sides. The Saxon right flank broke and gave chase thinking they had won. William was not dead and rallied his troops, cut off and slew the pursuing Saxons. He was then able to manoeuvre some of his cavalry on to the hilltop and fight the Saxons on level ground. The English shield wall managed to survive the repeated attacks of the Norman knights and the archers until the death of Harold, at dusk. The English survivors then fled into the forests of the Weald, and the day belonged to William. Thus ended the 'Kingdom of the English'.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ANISHNAABEK_PEDIA">[TAB]The Algonquian are one of the most populous and widespread North American Native groups, with tribes originally numbering in the hundreds, and hundreds of thousands who still identify with various Algonquian peoples. This grouping consists of peoples that speak Algonquian languages. Among the largest groups are the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe/Chippewa), Algonkins, Cree, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Shawnee and Abenaki.[PARAGRAPH:2]Before Europeans came into contact, most Algonquians lived by hunting and fishing, although quite a few supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, squash, and (particularly among the Ojibwe) wild rice. The Algonquians of New England (who spoke eastern Algonquian) practiced a seasonal economy. The basic social unit was the village of a few hundred people related by a kinship structure. Villages were temporary and mobile. They moved to locations of greatest natural food supply, often breaking into smaller units or recombining as the circumstances required. This custom resulted in a certain degree of cross-tribal mobility, especially in troubled times.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ojibwe[PARAGRAPH:2]The Ojibwe or Chippewa is the largest group of Native Americans-First Nations north of Mexico, including Métis. They are the third largest in the United States, surpassed only by Cherokee and Navajo. Because they were formerly located mainly around Sault Ste. Marie, at the outlet of Lake Superior, the French referred to them as Saulteurs. Ojibwa who subsequently moved to the prairie provinces of Canada have retained the name Saulteaux. Ojibwa who were originally located about the Mississagi River and made their way to southern Ontario are known as the Mississaugas.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a major component group of the Anishinaabe peoples - which includes the Algonquin, Nipissing, Oji-Cree, Odawa and the Potawatomi - the Ojibwe peoples number over 130,000. They are known for their birch bark canoes, sacred birch bark scrolls, the use of cowrie shells, wild rice, copper points, and for their use of gun technology from the British to defeat and push back the Dakota nation of the Sioux (1745). The Ojibwe Nation was the first to set the agenda for signing more detailed treaties with Canada's leaders before many settlers were allowed too far west. The Midewiwin Society is well respected as the keeper of detailed and complex scrolls of events, history, songs, maps, memories, stories, geometry, and mathematics.[PARAGRAPH:2]Blackfoot[PARAGRAPH:2]The Blackfoot Indians, also known as the Blackfeet Indians reside in the Great Plains of Montana and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The name Blackfoot is said to have come from the color of the peoples leather shoes, or moccasins. They had typically dyed or painted the bottoms of their moccasins black, but one story claimed that the Blackfoot Indians walked through ashes of prairie fires, which in turn colored the bottoms of their moccasins black. They had not originally come from the Great Plains of the Mid-West North America, but rather from the upper Northeastern part of the country. The Blackfoot started off as woodland Indians but as they progressively made their way over to the Plains, they had adapted to the ways of life and had become adept to the land. They learned the new lands they traveled to very well and established themselves as one of the most powerful Indian tribes among the Plains in the late 1700s and earning themselves the name \"The Lords of the Plains.\"[PARAGRAPH:2]Cree[PARAGRAPH:2]Cree is one of the largest group of indigenous peoples in North America, located mainly across Canada and historically in the United States from Minnesota westward but are found today in Montana. The Cree are generally divided into major groups: Naskapi, Montagnais, Attikamekw, James Bay Cree, Moose Cree, Swampy Cree, Woods Cree and Plains Cree. However, among the Cree, they usually referred to themselves collectively as Nehilawe(those who speak our language); they called themselves \"Cree\" only when speaking English or French. Skilled buffalo hunters and horsemen, the Plains Cree were allied to the Assiniboine and the Sioux before encountering English, Scottish (especially Orcadian) and French settlers in the 16th century. The Cree are the largest group of First Nations in Canada, with over 200,000 members and 135 registered bands.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ANIYONEGA_PEDIA">[TAB] The Cherokee were inhabitants of the southern reaches of the modern United States. Residing in what is today Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas, the Cherokee were among the most powerful peoples of their region. They also were among the first natives of North America to establish contact with Europeans, being among the peoples encountered by the Spaniard Hernando de Soto in his journey across the American South. [PARAGRAPH:2]The permanent settlement of North America by the English, however, placed significant pressure on the relations between the Cherokee and the Europeans. While siding with the English against the French during the French and Indian War, tensions came to a head in 1760 when a dispute between white settlers and the Cherokee exploded into all-out war. During what became known as \"The Cherokee War,\" the Cherokee won a series of impressive victories, including the capture of the English fortress of Loudoun. The English reaction was brutal, the settlers burning entire villages to the ground, and the Cherokee were eventually forced to return to the negotiating table. [PARAGRAPH:2]After the Cherokee War, the tensions between the Cherokee and the English eased, and with the coming of the Revolutionary War, the Cherokee once again sided with the English against the colonists. This slight would embitter relations between the colonists and the Cherokee and with the victory of the colonists, the Cherokee were left faced with a new, unfriendly country in the midst of their territory. Attempts at reconciliation were made, including the Cherokee's participation in a war against their enemies, the Creek, yet relations remained tense. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1830, President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which required the Cherokee to abandon their lands in the east and march west, to resettle in the area that is modern Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma. While promising to provide the Cherokee with food, protection and shelter, the American government failed in all three respects, turning the forced exile into a death march. Nearly four thousand Cherokee died in what became known as the \"Trail of Tears.\" [PARAGRAPH:2]Living in the west, the Cherokee managed to survive in the particularly precarious circumstances in which they were placed, yet their general abuse by the American government continued. Over the next seventy years, the lands given to the Cherokee were slowly whittled away by American policy and overeager settlers. By 1906, nearly all their land had been stolen by American settlers or made part of newly-formed states. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Cherokee would struggle to begin the slow process of reclaiming their native identity. With the discovery of oil in their remaining territory in the early 20th century and changes in American policy granting them more self-sovereignty, the fate of the Cherokee took a decidedly positive turn. Today, the Cherokee are among the most powerful and respected tribes in the United States, with members living in both Oklahoma and in their original homelands in the east.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_APACHE_PEDIA">[TAB]Natives of the inhospitable southwestern United States and northern Mexico, the Apache were nomadic people who built their society on a balance of commerce and raids. Thanks in part to their nomadic lifestyle and harsh homeland, the Apache were considered among the most formidable mounted warriors of the southwest. The name Apache itself came from a Zuni native word meaning \"enemy.\" [PARAGRAPH:2]The Spanish were the first to encounter the Apache when Francisco de Coronado, the Spanish conquistador who combed the American Southwest in the 16th century, met and traded with them. Relations between the Apache and the colonists remained relatively benign until the 19th century, when Mexico declared its independence from Spain. In the 1830s, seeking to gain control of the Southwest, the Mexican government began offering a reward for the scalps of the Apache. [PARAGRAPH:2]The violence that followed led many Apache, normally a series of independent tribes, to unite under the leadership of Mangas Coloradas. Coloradas' war against the Mexicans would continue for almost a decade before the United States, declaring war in 1846, defeated Mexico and laid claim to their territories. Coloradas agreed to sign a treaty with the Americans in return for self-sovereignty, but it did not last. The discovery of a wealth of minerals in Apache territory brought white settlers flocking to their lands. Seeing them as trespassers, the Apache led raids against the American settlers. In response, the US military sent forth troops to make war on the Apache. The ensuing conflict, which became known as the Apache Wars, continued for roughly ten years. [PARAGRAPH:2]During this time, Mangas Coloradas, as well as the Apache leader Cochise and the medicine man Geronimo, led guerilla forces against the Americans. The decade of war took its toll on the Apache - Coloradas was captured and executed during a treaty negotiation in 1863 and Cochise too was captured. To help stem the tide of violence, the American government authorized the creation of a reservation in San Carlos, Arizona, where the Apache could live separated from the white settlers. At first the Apache agreed to live on the territory, but found the restricting life on the reservation little to their liking. Geronimo along with numerous others escaped from the reservation on multiple occasions to wreak havoc on American encampments. During his final escape in 1886, nearly 6000 soldiers and volunteers were mobilized to try and recapture the Apache leader. [PARAGRAPH:2]After the surrender of Geronimo later that year, there was a great demand among the white settlers that the Apache be relocated, as it was clear the reservation could not hold them. Bowing to their constituents' demands, the American government scattered the Apache to the four winds. Some were moved east to Oklahoma. Geromino and his followers were imprisoned in Florida and not allowed to return to their home territory until 1914. Today, most modern Apache still live in the same region as their ancestors - Arizona and New Mexico, with many still living on their original reservation at San Carlos.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ARGENTINA_PEDIA">[TAB]The first signs of human presence in Argentina are located in the Patagonia (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and date from 11,000 BC. Around 1 AD, several corn-based civilizations developed in the western and northwestern Andean region (Ansilta, Condorhuasi, Cienaga, Aguada, Santa Maria, Huarpes, Diaguitas, Sanavirones, among others); some of them were conquered by the Quechuas and integrated into the Inca Empire as a region called Tucma or Tucumán. In the northestern area, the Guaraní developed a culture based on yuca and sweet potato. The central and southern areas (Pampas and Patagonia) were dominated by nomadic cultures, unified in the 17th century by the Mapuches, and never conquered by the Europeans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Europeans arrived in 1502. Spain established a permanent colony on the site of Buenos Aires in 1580, and the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776. In 1806 and 1807 the British Empire invaded the Viceroyalty, but the creole population managed to repel the invasions. On May 25, 1810, after the confirmation of the rumors about the overthrow of King Ferdinand VII by Napoleon, the most prominent citizens of Buenos Aires took advantage of the situation and created the First Government Junta. Independence from Spain was declared on July 9, 1816. Centralist and federationist groups were in conflict until national unity was established and the constitution promulgated in 1853.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 1880 to 1930, Argentina enjoyed increasing prosperity and prominence. Conservative forces dominated Argentine politics until 1916, when their traditional rivals, the Radicals, won control of the government. The military forced Hipólito Yrigoyen from power in 1930, leading to another decade of Conservative rule. Political change led to the presidency of Juan Perón in 1946, who tried to empower the working class and greatly expanded the number of unionized workers. The Revolución Libertadora of 1955 deposed him.[PARAGRAPH:2]From the 1950s to 1970s, military and civilian administrations traded power. The armed forces took power through a junta in charge of the self-appointed National Reorganization Process until 1983. The armed forces repressed opposition using harsh illegal measures (the \"Dirty War\"). Democracy was restored in 1983. Raúl Alfonsín's Radical government took steps to account for the \"disappeared\", established civilian control of the armed forces, and consolidated democratic institutions. the country started implementing new policies based on re-industrialization, import substitution, increased exports, and consistent fiscal surplus in 2002.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ARMENIA_PEDIA">[TAB]Armenia, officially the Republic of Armenia, is a landlocked mountainous country in Eurasia between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, located in the Southern Caucasus. It shares borders with Turkey to the west, Georgia to the north, Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and the Nakhichevan exclave of Azerbaijan to the south. A former republic of the Soviet Union, Armenia is a unitary, multiparty, democratic nation-state and one of the oldest and most historic civilizations in the world with a rich cultural heritage, as well as the first nation to adopt Christianity as its official religion. Although Armenia is constitutionally a secular state, the Christian faith plays a major role in both its history and the identification of the Armenian people.[PARAGRAPH:2]Culturally, historically, and politically, Armenia is considered to be part of Europe. However, its location in the southern Caucasus means that it can also be considered to be at the arbitrary border between Europe and Asia: in other words, a transcontinental nation.[PARAGRAPH:2]The original Armenian name for the country was Hayq. The name later evolved into Hayastan a combination of Hayasa or Hayk with the Persian suffix '-stan' (land) in the Middle Ages. Hayk was one of the great Armenian leaders after whom the The Land of Hayk was named. According to legend, Hayk was a great-great-grandson of Noah (son of Togarmah, who was a son of Gomer, who was a son of Japheth, who was a son of Noah), and according to an ancient Armenian tradition, a forefather of all Armenians. He is said to have settled at the foot of Mount Ararat, traveled to assist in building the Tower of Babel, and, after his return, defeated the Babylonian king Bel (believed by some researchers to be Nimrod) in 2492 BC near the mountains of Lake Van, in the southwestern part of historic Armenia (present-day eastern Turkey). Pre-Christian accounts suggest that Nairi, meaning \"land of rivers\", used to be an ancient name for the country's mountainous region, first used by Assyrians around 1200 BC. Greek Armenoi is attested in Herodotus, who reports that the Armenians were colonists of the Phrygians. The traditional etymology for the ethnology is from Armenak or Aram, the great-grandson of Haik's great-grandson, and another leader who is, according to Armenian tradition, the ancestor of all Armenians.[PARAGRAPH:2]Armenia has been populated since prehistoric times, and has been proposed as the site of the Biblical Garden of Eden. Armenia lies in the highlands surrounding the Biblical mountains of Ararat, upon which, as tradition states, Noah's Ark came to rest after the flood. (Gen. 8:4). Archaeologists continue to uncover evidence that Armenia and the Armenian Highlands were among the earliest sites of human civilization. From 6000 BC to 1000 BC, tools and trinkets of copper, bronze and iron were commonly produced in Armenia and traded in neighbouring lands where those metals were less abundant. The territory of Armenia is also one of the candidates for the legendary Aratta, mentioned in Sumerian records. In the Bronze Age, several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the Hittite Empire (at the height of its power), Mitanni (South-Western historic Armenia) and Hayasa-Azzi (15th - 12th cc BC). In the Iron Age, the Indo-European Phrygians and Mushkis arrive in the Near East, and topple the Mitanni Kingdom. Then, the Nairi people (12th - 9th cc BC) and the Kingdom of Urartu (9th - 6th cc BC) successively establish their sovereignty over the Armenian Highland. Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people. Yerevan, the modern capital of Armenia, was founded in 782 BC by the Urartian king Argishti I.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ASHANTI_PEDIA">[TAB]The Ashanti or Asante are a major ethnic group in Ghana. They were a powerful, militaristic, and highly disciplined people of West Africa. The ancient Ashanti migrated from the vicinity of the northwestern Niger River after the fall of the Ghana Empire in the 1200s. Evidence of this lies in the royal courts of the Akan kings reflected by that of the Ashanti kings whose processions and ceremonies show remnants of ancient Ghana ceremonies. Ethno linguists have substantiated the migration by tracing word usage and speech patterns along West Africa.[PARAGRAPH:2]Around the 13th century AD, the Ashanti and various other Akan peoples migrated into the forest belt of present-day Ghana and established small states in the hilly country around present-day Kumasi. During the height of the Mali Empire the Ashanti, and Akan people in general, became wealthy through the trading of gold mined from their territory. Early in Ashanti history, this gold was traded with the greater Ghana and Mali Empires.[PARAGRAPH:2]Akan political organization centered on various clans, each headed by a paramount chief or Amanhene. One of these clans, the Oyoko, settled Ghanaï¿½s sub-tropical forest region, establishing a center at Kumasi. During the rise of another Akan state known as Denkyira, the Ashanti became tributaries. Later in the mid-1600s, the Oyoko clan under Chief Oti Akenten started consolidating other Ashanti clans into a loose confederation that occurred without destroying the authority of each paramount chief over his clan. This was done in part by military assault, but largely by uniting them against the Denkyira, who had previously dominated the region.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 1670s, then head of the Oyoko clan Osei Tutu began another rapid consolidation of Akan peoples via diplomacy and warfare. King Osei Kofu Tutu I and his chief advisor, Okomfo Kwame Frimpon Anokye led a coalition of influential Ashanti city-states against their mutual oppressor, the Denkyira who held Asanteman as one of its tributaries. Asanteman utterly defeated them at the Battle of Feyiase, proclaiming its independence in 1701. Subsequently, through hard line force of arms and savoir-faire diplomacy, the duo induced the leaders of the other Ashanti city-states to declare allegiance and adherence to Kumasi, the Ashanti capital. Right from the onset, King Osei Tutu and Priest Anokye followed an expansionist and an imperialistic provincial foreign policy.[PARAGRAPH:2]In December 1895, Sir Francis Scott left Cape Coast with an expedition force. It arrived in Kumasi in January 1896. The Asantehene directed the Ashanti to not resist. Shortly thereafter, Governor William Maxwell arrived in Kumasi as well. Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh was deposed and arrested. Britain annexed the territories of the Ashanti and the Fanti in 1896, and Ashanti leaders were sent into exile in the Seychelles. The Asante Union was dissolved. Robert Baden-Powell led the British in this campaign. The British formally declared the coastal regions to be the Gold Coast colony. A British Resident was permanently placed in the city, and soon after a British fort.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today, the Ashanti monarchy continues as one of the constitutionally-protected, sub-national traditional states within the Republic of Ghana.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_AUSTRALIA_PEDIA">[TAB]As early as the Middle Ages, stories were told about the existence of a large continent on the Southern Hemisphere.  But Europeans had never seen it, and they referred to it as \"terra australis incognita,\" Latin for \"the unknown southern land.\"  While making their journeys between the Netherlands and their colonies, the Dutch were the first Europeans to see Australia.  The Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was sent out to explore the area, and although he sailed too far to see the mainland, he reached and explored what is now Tasmania.  No vigilant explorations of the continent were conducted until 1770, when James Cook, a British naval officer and explorer, sailed along its eastern coast and named it New South Wales.  He noted that the bay of New South Wales was appropriate for future settlement. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The first settlements were made when Britain had lost its colonies in the United States.  Looking for an alternate place that it could use to alleviate congested prisons, the British government established a penal colony at Botany Bay.  As more convicts came to Australia, new colonies were established in Tasmania and the mainland of Australia.  Several other explorers began a more thorough exploration of Australia, establishing that Tasmania was an island, crossing the Blue Mountains, and charting various islands. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Life was difficult during the early years in Sydney.  Attempts at farming failed in the poor soil, and it was not until better land was found along the Nepean Bay, to the west, that successful farms were set up and food supplies improved.  Whaling and wool increased Australia's development.  Free British settlers began arriving in the 1820s, and the first free colony was established at Swan River in 1829.  The colony of Victoria was formed between the years of 1835 and 1837.  As settlers began to move their sheep inland in the 1820s, more settlements were established wherever they found good pasture.  Even with high hopes, many of these later settlers found unrewarding and dry land.  The six colonies grew rapidly and all became autonomous during the latter half of the 1800s. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In time, the six colonies realized the benefits of working together, and they passed two constitutions in the years of 1891 and 1898.  On January 1, 1901, the six colonies became states in the new Commonwealth of Australia.  In both World War I and II, Australia fought on the side of Britain.  Australia also gave support to the United States forces in World War II.  Australia became more active in world affairs after World War II.  Australian troops were sent to Korea in 1950 as part of the United Nations command.  A large portion of Australia's national income is annually given to developing countries, especially those in the South Pacific region. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In order to increase Australian commerce, the government greatly encouraged immigration to Australia from European countries.  In the following years, millions of new Australians were resettled successfully.  However, during the 1980s, the number of European immigrants sharply decreased, and more refugees from Asian countries began to immigrate to Australia.  Increased awareness to the problems of the Australian Aboriginal peoples became evident in the late 1980s, and the government moved to help the Aboriginals.  After the economic boom in the 1980s, a sharp recession followed by unemployment occurred in the 1990s.  During this time, the government made actions to increased trade in Asian countries, which helped to restore the economy.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_AUSTRIA_PEDIA">[TAB]Austria was first settled by various Celtic tribes.  Noricum, a Celtic kingdom, was claimed by the Roman Empire and made a province.  After the Roman Empire's fall, Austria was invaded by Bavarians, Slavs, and Avars.  When Charlemagne conquered the land in 788, he encouraged colonization and Christianity.  Austria, now part of Eastern Francia, was under the control of the house of Babenberg.  In 976, the area known as Marchia Orientalis was given to Leopold of Babenberg in 976. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The first record of the land being known as Austria is in 966 when referring to the territory of the Babenberg March.  The following centuries are characterized by the early settlements of the country.  In 1156, the Privilegium Minus elevated Austria to the duchy statues.  The Babenbergs also gained the Duchy of Styria in 1192. [PARAGRAPH: 2] With the death of Frederick II in 1246, the Barenberg line ended.  Otakar II of Bohemia effectively controlled the duchies of Austria.  After his defeat and Durnkrut by Rudolf I of Germany in 1278, his reign came to an end.  The following centuries would mark a time of Austrian prosperity, under the ruling dynasty, the Habsburgs.  In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the Habsburgs accumulated provinces in the area of the Duchy of Austria.  In 1438, Duke Albert V of Austria was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, Emperor Sigismund.  Although Albert ruled for only a year, from that time on, every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with one exception. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The Habsburgs began to accumulate lands over the years, and in 1477 the Archduke Maximilian acquired most of the Low Countries after marrying the heiress of Burgundy.  His son Philip the Fair married the heiress of Castile and Aragon, and acquired Spain and its Italian, African, and New World adjuncts for the Habsburgs. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Following the Battle of Mohacs, Austrian rulers expanded their territories.  However, the Ottoman expansion into Hungary led to frequent conflicts between the two powers.  The long reign of Leopold I ended the Austrian conflict with the Turks.  Following the defense of Vienna in 1628, a series of campaigns resulted in the return of Hungary to Austrian Control in 1699.  However, during the latter part of the reign of Emperor Charles VI, Austria surrendered some of these gains.  After this time, the age of Austrian-Prussian dualism began in Hungary. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Various defeats against Napoleon spelled the end of the old Holy Roman Empire in 1806, and in 1804 the Austrian Empire was founded.  In 1867, it was transformed into the dual-monarchy of Austria-Hungary.  Following the Napoleonic wars, Austria emerged as one of Europe's dominant powers along with Prussia and Russia.  In 1815, the German Confederation was founded under the presidency of Austria.  Austria and Prussia were one of the two leading powers.  After Germany wished to become a unified country, Austria was unwilling to become part of it and grew out of Germany, while Prussia grew into it.  Following the defeat of Prussia at the battle of Koniggratz in Bohemia, Austria had to leave the German Confederation and was subsequently no longer permitted to take part in German politics. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 provided a dual sovereignty under Franz Joseph I, who ruled until his death.  The diversity of the empire made it difficult to control in an age of emerging nationalist movements.  The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 was the probable cause of World War I, which led to the downfall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. [PARAGRAPH: 2] In 1918 and 1919, Austria was known as the Republic of German Austria.  The monarchy was, however, dissolved in 1919 and a parliamentary democracy was set up in 1920.  In 1922, Austria was given a loan to improve the general economic condition.  With the granting of the loan, Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. At the time, the real ruler of Austria became the League, through its commissioner in Vienna. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The First Austrian Republic lasted until 1933.  The two major parties fought each other within the parliament.  After the Austrian Civil War in 1934, several members of the Schutzbund Party were executed and the Social Democratic Party was outlawed.  In 1936, German troops occupied the country and Hitler, a native of Austria himself, lost citizenship in 1925.  Just before the collapse of the Third Reich, Karl Renner set up a Provisional Government in Vienna.  Much like Germany, Austria, too, was divided into a British, French, a Soviet and an American Zone and governed by the Allied Commission for Austria. [PARAGRAPH: 2] On May 1955, Austria regained independence and declared itself permanently neutral, which it remains today. The political system of the Second Republic came to be characterized by the system of Proporz, meaning that most posts of some political importance were split evenly between members of the Social Democrats and the People's Party.  Today, Austria has five major parties: the SPO (Labour Party), the OVP (Conservatives), the Greens (Environmentalists), and FPO (nationalists).  Austria became a member of the European Union in 1995, and has retained its constitutional neutrality.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_BAKTRIA_PEDIA">[TAB]\"Of all the frontiers of the ancient world, none has endured so long in the poetic imagination as the kingdom of Baktria. In those distant haunts of the Hindu Kush, nearly three thousand miles east of Athens, the Hellenes imagined a never-never land untouched by civilization. Rivers of honey oozed on the Baktrian frontier; fierce griffins guarded the precious gold mined by giant ants; people had ears the size of an elephant's, ate their parents, and lived for centuries.\" According to tradition, the god Dionysos was the first to tame this land, then Herakles, and finally Alexandros. The realities of the kingdom of Baktria are more difficult to come by however, and the influence of the Iranian peoples played a larger role than the legends reveal. While the history and culture of the kingdom of Baktria is obscured in the mists at its home near the top of the world, it is known that at its largest extent it encompassed an area consisting of all of Turkmenistan, Tadzhikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, up to the Indus.\"[PARAGRAPH:2]The Baktrian Kingdom was founded around 250 BC by the Seleukid King Antiochos II's satrap Diodotos in the region, when he secured his satrapy's independence from the seemingly irresponsible Seleukids. Though Diodotos' reign was relatively free of major emergencies, it was exceedingly brief, and was ended by one of the first internal feuds that characterized Baktrian politics for almost all of it's history.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 230 BC, Diodotos was overthrown and killed by Euthydemos, who managed to secure the kingdom's possessions in the North around Ferghana and Sogdiane. During the first decade of his reign, Euthydemos fought frequently and inconclusively with the Parthians in the West, but reportedly secured some minor new Western territories, though these minor operations received no follow-up. Only ten years after his reign began, an expedition out of Alexandreia Eschate, resulted in the first Hellenic contact with China. Though the two peoples did maintain a profitable trade agreement, it led to a great mixing of cultures between both. The Baktrian Hellenes were mostly unaffected (though Chinese goods would eventually grace the shelves of Baktrian markets more frequently), but the contact supposedly inspired a great many principles within Chinese art that had been previously unseen in the mainstream. One particular notable instance suggested by Chinese records is the first Emperor Qin's terracota army, which might have been inspired by Hellenic figure design. This first expedition also led to the contacts that would eventually develop the Silk Road. With a comfortable frontier in the North and East, Euthydemos eventually met the Seleukid army under the direct command of King Antiochos III, approaching his South-Western border after successful campaigning in the area. During the ensuing conflict, Euthydemos managed to first repel an attack by the full Seleukid force, and to resist a two year siege; eventually managing to convince Antiochos of the value of an independent Hellenic kingdom in the far East. Recognizing the potential danger of the warlike nomads in the East, Antiochos decided to grant Euthydemos' kingdom it's independence so that they might serve as a buffer against further Eastern incursions in to the empire, and sealed the agreement by marrying one of his daughters to Euthydemos' son Demetrios.[PARAGRAPH:2]With the Seleukid threat to his kingdom neutralized, the Baktrians began focusing on conquest and the assimilation of several Western territories. Only a few years after Antiochos' departure, Euthydemos managed to absorb some of the old Northern provinces of Persia, and finally managed to subdue much of Parthia, thanks to their state of weakness after Antiochos' victories against them. Having secured much of Parthia, Euthydemos ruled for about a decade more before his death, of seemingly natural causes. During this time and the early years of his son's rule, the Baktrian borders remained static, save for a few varying losses and acquisitions in the West. His most significant undertaking, however, was an invasion of the Sungan kingdom in Northern India. This invasion was incredibly successful, with Demetrios securing almost all of the Sungan possessions, up to their capital - bringing the Hellenic rulers for the first time into power over lands heavily populated by an Indian majority. The influx of Hellenes into these possessions brought about a culture mingling between the Buddhists of India and the Hellenes, that would continue for five centuries after the rule of Hellenes ended in the region, influencing modern Buddhism in a variety of ways - and creating the Gandhara culture that would last a millenia. Examples of this Hellenic influence are more apparent then most would imagine, as the first statues of the Buddha himself were very likely executed by Hellenic artisans or commissioned by Hellenes. Before the Hellenes' arrival, most Buddhists in Northern India represented the Buddha with a small plethora of symbols; almost never giving him his human form in their design. It was also the Hellenes who first depicted him as standing or walking in their statuary design.[PARAGRAPH:2]By 175 BC, the conquest of India was completed, and most of Northern and North-Western India wasin Hellenic hands. Hellenic rule here was so successful, that it would outlast the actual Baktrian kingdom itself in the North, where even at this time internal feuding was once again disrupting the kingdom's growth. In Baktria itself, Antiochos III's cousin Eukratides had managed to secure the loyalty of all Demetrios' possessions before the path he followed to India. At the beginning of his rule, the Parthians reconquored the Baktrian's Western possessions, and Demetrios' brother Anthimachos I led an unsuccessful resistance to his rebellion, weakening him against the eventual reprisals of Demetrios, who was approaching once again from India. The two confronted each other, when Demetrios marched an army of 60,000 men, composed of Hellenes, Indians, and even some of his levies from inside Baktria itself. Despite numerical superiority, Eukratides managed to defeat Demetrios, forcing him to retreat into India - where his successors would rule for almost two centuries, promoting a further melding of cultures that would nearly complete the development of the Gandhara culture, and the creation of a Greaco-Hindu Buddhist pantheon focused around Apollo and the Buddha. Though Demetrius had been defeated by the Greaco-Baktrian army, his future successor Menandros I took his revenge for him, by recapturing most of Southern Baktria from Eukratides' successor, Eukratides II. After only a few years on the throne, Eukratides was also replaced through the political maneuvering of Platon Epiphanes around 166 BC, who ruled for twenty years of territorial loss and internal feuding. Upon Eukratides' death, Heliokles came into power, and ruled over the finally collapsing Graeco-Baktrian kingdom. The kingdom's final downfall came in 125 when he abandoned Baktria to the Yuezhi who had been eating up his territory for most of his rule, and moved his capital into the Hellenic territory of Northern India.</string>

However, it was separated from the western wing by 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) across India. Political and linguistic discrimination as well as economic neglect led to popular agitations against West Pakistan, which led to the war for independence in 1971 and the establishment of Bangladesh. After independence the new state endured famines, natural disasters and widespread poverty, as well as political turmoil and military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative calm and economic progress.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bangladesh is the seventh most populous country in the world and is among the most densely populated countries in the world with a high poverty rate. However, per-capita GDP has more than doubled since 1975, and the poverty rate has fallen by 20% since the early 1990s. The country is listed among the \"Next Eleven\" economies. Dhaka and other urban centers have been the driving force behind this growth.[PARAGRAPH:2]Remnants of civilization in the greater Bengal region date back four thousand years, when the region was settled by Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, and Austro-Asiatic peoples. The exact origin of the word \"Bangla\" or \"Bengal\" is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from Bang, the Dravidian-speaking tribe that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC.[PARAGRAPH:2]The kingdom of Gangaridai was formed from at least the seventh century BC, which later united with Bihar under the Magadha, Nanda, Mauryan and Sunga Empires. Bengal was later part of the Gupta Empire and Harsha Empire from the third to the sixth centuries CE. Following its collapse, a dynamic Bengali named Shashanka founded an impressive yet short-lived kingdom. Shashanka is considered the first independent king in the history of Bangladesh. After a period of anarchy, the Buddhist Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by a shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty. Islam was introduced to Bengal in the twelfth century by Arab Muslim merchants and Sufi missionaries, and subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region. Bakhtiar Khilji, a Turkic general, defeated Lakshman Sen of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal in the year 1204. The region was ruled by dynasties of Sultans and land lords Bhuiyan for the next few hundred years. By the 16th century, the Mughal Empire controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important provincial centre of Mughal administration.[PARAGRAPH:2]European traders arrived late in the 15th century, and their influence grew until the British East India Company gained control of Bengal following the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The bloody rebellion of 1857, known as the Sepoy Mutiny, resulted in transfer of authority to the crown, with a British viceroy running the administration. During colonial rule, famine racked the Indian subcontinent many times, including the Great Bengal famine of 1943 that claimed 3 million lives.[PARAGRAPH:2]In January 11, 2007, following widespread violence, a caretaker government was appointed to administer the next general election. The country had suffered from extensive corruption, disorder and political violence. The new caretaker government has made it a priority to root out corruption from all levels of government. To this end, many notable politicians and officials, along with large numbers of lesser officials and party members, have been arrested on corruption charges. The caretaker government held a fair and free election on December 29, 2008. Awami League's Sheikh Hasina won the elections with a landslide victory and took oath of Prime Minister on 6 Jan 2009.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_BATAVII_PEDIA">[TAB][TAB]The Batavii (or Batavi, Batavians) were a Germanic, or possibly Celtic tribe reported by Julius Caesar and Tacitus to have lived around the Rhine delta, in the area which is currently the Netherlands. This led to the Latin name of Batavia.[PARAGRAPH:2]They were mentioned by Julius Caesar in his commentary Gallic Wars, as living on an island formed by the Meuse River after it is joined by the Waal, 80 Roman miles from the mouth of the river. He said there were many other islands formed by branches of the Rhine, inhabited by savage and barbarous nations, some of whom were supposed to live on fish and the eggs of sea-fowl.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tacitus described the Batavi as the most brave of the tribes of the area, inhabiting not much territory on the Rhine but an island in it. They were formerly part of the Cattans[?] but moved after a feud to become part of the Roman Empire. He said they retained the honour of the ancient association with the Romans, not required to pay tribute or taxes and used by the Romans only for war. He named the Mattiacians[?] as a similar tribe under homage, but on the other (Germanic) side of the Rhine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Also the areas inhabited by the Batavians where never occupied by the Romans, they were allies. In 69 CE, a rebellion led by Julius Civilis arose, which was defeated by the Romans the following year.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the 3rd century CE, the Batavians are no longer mentioned, and they are assumed to have merged with the neighbouring Frisian and Frankish people.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Batavians became regarded as the eponymous ancestors of the Dutch people. The Netherlands were briefly known as the Batavian Republic.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_BELGIUM_PEDIA">[TAB]In the 1st century BC, the Romans, after defeating the local tribes, created the province of Gallia Belgica. A gradual immigration by Germanic Frankish tribes during the 5th century, brought the area under the rule of the Merovingian kings. A gradual shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to evolve into the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the region into Middle and Western Francia and therefore into a set of more or less independent fiefdoms which during the Middle Ages were vassals either of the King of France or of the Roman Emperor. Many of these fiefdoms were united in the Burgundian Netherlands of the 14th and 15th centuries. Emperor Charles V extended the personal union of the Seventeen Provinces in the 1540s, making it far more than a personal union by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 and increased his influence over the Prince-Bishopric of Liège.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Eighty Years' War (15681648) divided the Low Countries into the northern United Provinces (Belgica Foederata in Latin, the \"Federated Netherlands\") and the Southern Netherlands (Belgica Regia, the \"Royal Netherlands\"). The latter were ruled successively by the Spanish and the Austrian Habsburgs and comprised most of modern Belgium. This was the theatre of most Franco-Spanish and Franco-Austrian wars during the 17th and 18th centuries. Following the campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars, the Low Countries  including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule, such as the Prince-Bishopric of Liège  were annexed by the French First Republic, ending Austrian rule in the region. The reunification of the Low Countries as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands occurred at the dissolution of the First French Empire in 1815. The 1830 Belgian Revolution led to the establishment of an independent, Catholic and neutral Belgium under a provisional government and a national congress. Since the installation of Leopold I as king in 1831, Belgium has been a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy. Although the franchise was initially restricted, universal suffrage for men was introduced in 1893 (with plural voting until 1919) and for women in 1949. The main political parties of the 19th century were the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party, with the Belgian Labour Party emerging towards the end of the century. French was originally the single official language adopted by the nobility and the bourgeoisie. It progressively lost its overall importance as Dutch became recognized as well. This recognition became official in 1898 and in 1967 a Dutch version of the Constitution was legally accepted.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Berlin Conference of 1885 acceeded control of the Congo Free State to King Leopold II as his private possession. From around 1900 there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under Leopold II, for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. In 1908 this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony, henceforth called the Belgian Congo.[PARAGRAPH:2]Germany invaded Belgium in 1914 as part of the Schlieffen Plan and much of the Western Front fighting of World War I occurred in western parts of the country. Belgium took over the German colonies of Ruanda-Urundi (modern day Rwanda and Burundi) during the war and they were mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the League of Nations. In the aftermath of the first World War, the Prussian districts of Eupen and Malmedy were annexed by Belgium 1925, thereby causing the presence of a German-speaking minority. The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940 during the Blitzkrieg offensive and occupied until its liberation in 1945 by the Allies. The Belgian Congo gained independence in 1960 during the Congo Crisis; Ruanda-Urundi followed two years later.[PARAGRAPH:2]After World War II, Belgium joined NATO as a founding member and formed the Benelux group of nations with the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Belgium became one of the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and of the European Atomic Energy Community and European Economic Community, established in 1957. The latter is now the European Union, for which Belgium hosts major administrations and institutions, including the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the European Parliament.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_BENIN_PEDIA">[TAB]The Benin Empire or Edo Empire was a large pre-colonial African state of modern Nigeria.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to one traditional account, the original people and founders of the Benin Empire, the Bini, were initially ruled by the Ogisos (Kings of the Sky). The city of Ibinu (later called Benin City) was founded in 1180 AD. About 36 known Ogiso are accounted for as rulers of the empire. [PARAGRAPH:2]Oranmiyan, the son of Ekaladerhan aka Oduduwa, agreed to go to Benin. He spent some years in Benin and came back to Ife after his wife gave birth to a son named Eweka. Eweka I became the first Oba of Benin. In 1440, Oba Ewuare (Ewuare the Great) came to power and turned the city-state into an empire. Around 1470, he named the new state Edo. The Oba had become the paramount power within the region. Oba Ewuare, the first Golden Age Oba, is credited with turning Benin City into a military fortress protected by moats and walls. It was from this bastion that he launched his military campaigns and began the expansion of the kingdom from the Edo-speaking heartlands. The lands of Idah, Owo, Akure all came under the central authority of the Edo Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]At its maximum extent the empire is claimed by the Edos to have extended from Onitsha in the east, through the forested southwestern region of Nigeria and into the present-day nation of Ghana. The Ga peoples of Ghana trace their ancestry to the ancient Kingdom of Benin. The state developed an advanced artistic culture especially in its famous artifacts of bronze, iron and ivory. These include bronze wall plaques and life-sized bronze heads of the Obas of Benin. The most common artifact is based on Queen Idia, porpularly called the FESTAC mask. Benin grew increasingly rich during the 16th and 17th centuries on the slave trade with Europe; slaves from enemy states of the interior were sold, and carried to the Americas in Dutch and Portuguese ships. The Bight of Benin's shore soon came to be known as the \"Slave Coast.\"[PARAGRAPH:2]The city and empire of Benin declined after 1700, but revived in the 19th century with the development of the trade in palm oil, enslaved captives, and textiles. To preserve Benin's independence, bit by bit the Oba banned the export of goods from Benin, until the trade was exclusively in palm oil.[PARAGRAPH:2]Benin resisted signing a protectorate treaty with Great Britain through most of the 1880s and 1890s. However, after the slaying of eight British representatives in Benin territory, a 'Punitive Expedition' was launched in 1897, in which a British force, under the command of Admiral Sir Harry Rawson, conquered and burned the city, destroying much of the countrys treasured art and dispersing nearly all that remained. The portrait figures, busts, and groups created in iron, carved ivory, and especially in brass (conventionally called the \"Benin Bronzes\") made in Benin are now displayed in museums around the world.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_BRAZIL_PEDIA">[TAB]Brazil is thought to have been inhabited for at least 10,000 years by semi-nomadic populations before the first Portuguese explorers, led by Pedro Álvares Cabral, disembarked in 1500. Over the next three centuries, it was resettled by the Portuguese and exploited mainly for brazilwood (Pau-Brasil) at first, and later for sugarcane (Cana-de-Açúcar) agriculture, coffee beans and gold mining. The colony's source of manpower was initially on enslaved Amerindians, and after 1550, mainly African slaves. In 1808, Queen Maria I of Portugal and her son and regent, the future João VI of Portugal, fleeing from Napoleon, relocated to Brazil with the royal family, nobles and government.[PARAGRAPH:2]Salvador is Brazil's third city in population and was the country's capital until 1763.Though they returned to Portugal in 1821, the interlude led to the opening of commercial ports to the United Kingdom - at the time isolated from most European ports by Napoleon - and to the elevation of Brazil to the status of a united kingdom with Portugal's Crown. Then prince regent Dom Pedro I (later Pedro IV of Portugal) declared independence on 7 September 1822, establishing the independent Empire of Brazil. As the crown remained in the hands of the house of Bragança, this was more the severance of the Portuguese empire in two, than an independence movement as seen elsewhere in the Americas.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Brazilian Empire was theoretically a democracy in the British style, although in practice, the emperor-premier-parliament balance of power more closely resembled the autocratic Austrian Empire. Slavery was abolished in 1888, through the \"Golden Law\", created by Princess Isabel, and intensive European immigration created the basis for industrialization. Pedro I was succeeded by his son, Pedro II - who in old age was caught by a political dispute between the Army and the Cabinet, a crisis arising from the Paraguay War. In order to avoid a civil war between Army and Navy, Pedro II renounced the throne on 15 November 1889, when a federal republic (officially, the Republic of the United States of Brazil) was established by Field Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dom Pedro I declaring independence from Portugal on September 7, 1822. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Brazil attracted over 5 million European and Japanese immigrants. That period also saw Brazil industrialize, further colonize, and develop its interior. Brazilian democracy was replaced by dictatorships three times - 1930-1934 and 1937-1945 under Getúlio Vargas, and 1964-1985, under a succession of generals appointed by the military. Since 1985, Brazil has been internationally considered a democracy, specifically a presidential democracy, which was kept after a plebiscite in 1993 where voters had to choose between a presidential or parliamentary system, whilst also choosing if Brazil should reinstate its constitutional monarchy.[PARAGRAPH:2]A key feature of democracy in contemporary Brazil is the existence of a vibrant and participatory civil society. NGOs and citizen organizations are at the forefront of the struggle for human rights, gender equality and economic justice. </string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_BULGARIA_PEDIA">[TAB]The Bulgars arrived in the region from Central Asia in the 600s AD.  They conquered the part of the Balkan Peninsula occupied by Slavs from the Byzantine Empire.  In 681, Byzantium acknowledged the first Bulgarian empire, which lasted until 1081.  Although they had ruled the country, the Bulgars adopted the language and traditions of the Slavs.  During the Middle Ages, Bulgaria was a great military power.  It frequently battled the Byzantine Empire and other neighbors and invaders.  In 865 the Bulgarian ruler Tsar Boris I converted to Christianity.  He set up the independent Bulgarian church and introduced the Cyrillic alphabet.  This new language and church spread to other parts of eastern Europe, including Russia.  During the reign of Boris's son, Simeon I, Bulgaria expanded both territorially and culturally. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Bulgaria declined in influence after Simeon's death.  In 1018 the Byzantine emperor Basil II defeated the country and ended the first Bulgarian empire.  Bulgaria remained part of the Byzantine Empire until 1186.  In 1186, John Asen I and his brother Peter recovered Bulgaria's independence.  Art and literature flourished under the reign of Tsar John Asen II, and many churches were founded.  But in 1396, together with the remaining Balkan states, Bulgaria was conquered by the Ottoman Turks. [PARAGRAPH: 1] During the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian nobility diminished and the church had little power.  Bulgarian farmers were made serfs to Turkish masters.  The Bulgarians almost lost their cultural identity, for the ability to read and write had declined and few could recall their people's history.  However, a Bulgarian national revival began in the 1800s.  An independent Bulgarian church was reinstated in 1870.  Some Bulgarians moved to the mountains and initiated a guerrilla campaign against Turkish rule. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Russia helped Bulgaria to earn political independence.  Because many western European powers feared Russian expansion, only northern Bulgaria was freed.  However, in 1885, the southern part of the country was reunited with Bulgaria.  The European powers of the time did not believe that the Bulgarians were skilled enough to govern their own country in a democratic fashion.  Instead, they proposed Bulgaria be ruled by a foreign monarch, first by Alexander Battenberg.  However, Alexander gave up the throne in 1886, and it was passed on to Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.  [PARAGRAPH: 1] In 1907, Prince Ferdinand assumed the title of Tsar and claimed the areas of old Bulgaria, particularly Macedonia.  A Balkan alliance was created among Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece.  This alliance fought against the Turks in the First Balkan War in 1912.  After bickering among themselves, Bulgaria was defeated by an alliance of Greece, Serbia, Romania, and Turkey in the Second Balkan War.  This resulted in Bulgaria giving up its claims to Macedonia. [PARAGRAPH: 1] During World War I, Bulgaria allied itself with Germany and Austria-Hungary.  Being on the losing side, it was forced to give up more land.  Economic and political difficulties were caused with a flood of refugees from Macedonia and large war reparations.  During World War II, Bulgaria allied itself with Germany once again.  In 1944, Bulgaria held peace discussions with the Allies.  Because these peace talks moved slowly, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria and Bulgarian Communist leaders took power.  In 1946, the monarchy was abolished and Bulgaria adopted a Communist government.  During the years of Communist rule, political and cultural freedom was limited but industry was encouraged.  In 1989, several Communist leaders were removed from power, leaving room for opposing parties to enter the government.  The first elections under the new constitution were held in 1991.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_BURMA_PEDIA">[TAB]Humans lived in the region that is now Burma as early as 11,000 years ago, but the first identifiable civilisation is that of the Pyu although both Burman and Mon tradition claim that the fabled Suvarnabhumi mentioned in ancient Pali and Sanskrit texts was a Mon kingdom centred on Thaton in present day Mon state. Artifacts from the excavated site of Nyaunggan help to reconstruct Bronze Age life in Burma and the more recent archaeological evidence at Samon Valley south of Mandalay suggests rice growing settlements between about 500 BC and AD 200 which traded with Qin and Han dynasty China.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 6th century Mon kingdom of Dvaravati in the lower Chao Phraya valley in present day Thailand extended its frontiers to the Tenasserim Yoma (mountains). With subjugation by the Khmer Empire from Angkor in the 11th century the Mon shifted further west deeper into present day Burma. Oral tradition suggests that they had contact with Buddhism via seafaring as early as the 3rd century BC and had received an envoy of monks from Ashoka in the 2nd century BC. The Mons adopted Indian culture together with Theravada Buddhism and are thought to have founded kingdoms in Lower Burma including Thaton in the 6th or 7th century and Bago (Pegu) in 825 with the kingdom of Raman'n'adesa (or Ramanna which is believed to be Thaton) referenced by Arab geographers in 844-8. The lack of archaeological evidence for this may in part be due to the focus of excavation work predominantly being in Upper Burma.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the fall of Pagan, the Mongols left in the searing Irrawaddy valley but the Pagan Kingdom was irreparably broken up into several small kingdoms. By the early 15th century, the country became organized along four major power centers: Upper Burma, Lower Burma, Shan States and Arakan. Many of the power centers were themselves made up of (often loosely held) minor kingdoms or princely states. This era was marked by a series of wars and switching alliances. Smaller kingdoms played a precarious game of paying allegiance to more powerful states, sometimes simultaneously.[PARAGRAPH:2]Britain made Burma a province of India in 1886 with the capital at Rangoon. Traditional Burmese society was drastically altered by the demise of the monarchy and the separation of religion and state. Though war officially ended after only a couple of weeks, resistance continued in northern Burma until 1890. The economic nature of society also changed dramatically. After the opening of the Suez Canal, the demand for Burmese rice grew and vast tracts of land were opened up for cultivation. However, in order to prepare the new land for cultivation, farmers were forced to borrow money from Indian moneylenders called chettiars at high interest rates and were often foreclosed on and evicted losing land and livestock. Most of the jobs also went to indentured Indian labourers, and whole villages became outlawed as they resorted to 'dacoity' (armed robbery).[PARAGRAPH:2]The first years of Burmese independence were marked by successive insurgencies by the Red Flag Communists led by Thakin Soe, the White Flag Communists led by Thakin Than Tun, the Yèbaw Hpyu (White-band PVO) led by Bo La Yaung, a member of the Thirty Comrades, army rebels calling themselves the Revolutionary Burma Army (RBA) led by Communist officers Bo Zeya, Bo Yan Aung and Bo Yè Htut. Remote areas of Northern Burma were for many years controlled by an army of Kuomintang (KMT) forces after the Communist victory in China in 1949. Burma accepted foreign assistance in rebuilding the country in these early years, but continued American support for the Chinese Nationalist military presence in Burma finally resulted in the country rejecting most foreign aid, refusing to join the South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and supporting the Bandung Conference of 1955. Burma generally strove to be impartial in world affairs and was one of the first countries in the world to recognize Israel and the People's Republic of China.[PARAGRAPH:2]The military government announced a change of name for the country in English from Burma to Myanmar in 1989. It also continued the economic reforms started by the old regime and called for a Constituent Assembly to revise the 1974 Constitution. This led to multiparty elections in May 1990 in which the National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide victory over the National Unity Party (NUP, the successor to the BSPP) and about a dozen smaller parties. The military, however, would not let the assembly convene, and continued to hold the two leaders of the NLD, U Tin U and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Aung San, under house arrest imposed on them the previous year. Burma came under increasing international pressure to convene the elected assembly, particularly after Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, and also faced economic sanctions. In April 1992 the military replaced Saw Maung with General Than Shwe.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_CANADA_PEDIA">[TAB]Various groups of prehistoric peoples inhabited what is now Canada.  Europeans first arrived when the Vikings briefly settled in Canada around 1000 AD.  In the late 1400s and early 1500s, France and England began to send explorers to Canada.  French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and set up the first enduring European settlements at Port Royal in 1605 and Quebec City in 1608.  These new colonies would come to be known as New France.  Various fur traders came to Canada to participate in the trade with the Native Americans.  When tensions grew, the French and Iroquois Wars broke out over control of the fur trade. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Once the English began settling in Canada and the Thirteen Colonies, several wars broke out resulting in much of the French lands in Canada to be ceded to England.  Canadian borders expanded, and it saw a high number of Irish and British immigrants in the early 1800s.  The timber industry would also surpass the fur trade in importance during this time.  The desire for Responsible Government resulted after the Rebellions of 1837.  The Act of Union in 1840 united all the Canadian lands into a United Province of Canada.  French and English Canadians worked together in the Assembly to restore French rights, which had long been overlooked after Britain's domination in the 1800s. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Canada expanded even more in the mid-1800s through a series of westward expeditions.  The move toward uniting Upper and Lower Canada into one country increased during this time of increased English Canadian nationalism.  Following several constitutional conferences, the British North America Act brought about a Confederation creating one country under the name Canada with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.  In time, other provinces joined the Confederation. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Prime Minster John A. Macdonald's Conservative Party set up a National Policy of tariffs to protect emerging Canadian manufacturing industries.  The open the West, the government sponsored construction of three transcontinental railways.  Additionally, the government opened the prairies settlements and established its dominion over the territory.  After the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898, the government decided to create the Yukon Territory as a separate territory.  In 1905, Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces as more immigrants settled in the prairies. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Canada entered World War I in 1914, sending volunteers to the Western Front.  In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain.  In 1931, the Statute of Westminster asserted Canada's independence.  The Great Depression of 1929 brought economic hardship to Canada.  Canada declared war on Germany independently during World War II under Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, three days after Britain.  The Canadian economy boomed as industry manufactured military material for itself, Britain, China and the Soviet Union.  Canada finished the war with one of the largest armed forces in the world [PARAGRAPH: 1] Quebec experienced deep social and economic changes during the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s.  Under successive Liberal governments of Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Trudeau, a new Canadian identity emerged.  Canada adopted its current Maple Leaf Flag in 1965.  Various acts combating cultural discrimination were passed in the 1960s and 1970s as waves of non-European immigration changed the face of the country.  Social democratic programs such as Universal Healthcare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans were passed during this time.  In the 1980s, the Canadian government pushed toward free trade and closer relations with the United States.  Because of these moves and others toward America, many Canadians worry about their cultural difference from the United States. However, Canadians take special pride in their system of universal healthcare and their commitment to multiculturalism.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_CHAMPA_PEDIA">[TAB]The Cham people reached the mainland of Champa from Borneo in the first and second centuries BC.  The Chams are descendents of the Sa Huynh people.  The Sa Huynh people were skilled craftsmen of jewelry and ornaments made with hard stones and glass.   From about 200 AD, the central coast of Vietnam was inhabited by the Chams.  After the seventh century, Champa included the modern provinces of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Ding, Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, and Binh Thuan.  Chinese and Funan influenced early Cham culture strongly because of the warring that went on between the Funan and Cham.  The frequent intermarriages between countries helped keep the peace in Champa.[PARAGRAPH: 2] Before 1471, Champa was a confederation of four or five principalities.  These principalities were also named after cities, which were Indrapura, Amaravati, Vijaya, Kauthara, and Panduranga.  Within these principalities, there were two groups: the Dua and the Cau.  The Dua lived in Amaravati and Vijaya while the Cau lived in Kauthara and Pandaranga.  The conflicting habits and customs of the clans lead to clashes and even war.  The two clans usually settled disputes by means of intermarriage. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Cham history is characterized by frequent military conflict with the Chinese, the Khmer, Vietnamese, and Mongols.  The Cham had both success and failures of the years.  In the twelfth century, the Cham warred repeatedly with the Khmer.  The Cham attacked the Khmer capital near Angkor in 1177, and sacked it in 1178 followed by a seaborne invasion from the lake Tonle Sap.  In 1178 Jayavarman VII, a Khmer prince, captured the Cham capital in a series of naval wars.  The chain of wars ended in 1203 when Jayavarman VIII of the Khmers occupied southern Champa and made it a Khmer Province.  However, in 1220 the Cham regained their independence. [PARAGRAPH: 2] In 1281 the Mongols sent a fleet to Champa after the king Indravarman V refused to give tribute to Kublai Khan.  The Cham people hid in the hills out of fright.  A year later, the Mongols sent a large army to attack Cham.  The army marched through Champa without the permission of the Vietnamese.  The Vietnamese and Cham attacked the Mongols, who eventually withdrew. [PARAGRAPH: 2] In 1312, the Vietnamese King Tran Anh Tong defeated the Cham and made them a vassal state for fourteen years.  The Cham king Che Bong Nga managed to unite the Cham lands and attack Vietnam from the sea.  Che Bong Nga managed to capture almost the whole of the country.  Cham armies sacked the capital city, Hanoi, in 1372 and later in 1377.  The last attack was in 1388 and was the last serious offense against Vietnam.  In 1446, the Dai Viet attacked Champa under the leadership of Trinh Kha who for a short time captured the city of Vijaya.  Despite the Vietnamese losing this war, in 1470 under the leadership of Le Thanh Tong, the Cham were attacked.  Vijaya and the king Tra Toan were captured by the Vietnamese.  This defeat caused many Cham people to move to Cambodia and Malacca. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The principality of Panduranga preserved some of its independence from the Vietnamese, and was the starting point of the modern Cham Lords.  A Cham aristocrat named Oknha Dat helped defeat the Nguyen forces in 1695.  As a result, the Cham Lords were made local lords of Panduranga and were closely supervised by Nguyen officials.  The power of the Cham lords was, however, limited and their power began declining over the years.  The Cham lords' title was later downgraded to prefect.  The Cham rule came to an end in 1832, when Emperor Minh Mang seized the area.</string>

The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of Spanish conquistadors, who came from Peru in 1535 seeking gold. The Spanish encountered hundreds of thousands of Native Americans from various cultures in the area that modern Chile now occupies. These cultures supported themselves principally through slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting. The conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by Pedro de Valdivia, one of Francisco Pizarro's lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on February 12, 1541. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1817 an army led by José de San Martin and Chile's most renowned patriot Bernardo O'Higgins crossed the Andes into Chile and defeated the royalists. On February 12, 1818, Chile was proclaimed an independent republic under San Martin's leadership. A military coup led by General Luis Altamirano in 1924 set off a period of great political instability that lasted until 1932. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. [PARAGRAPH:2]By early 1973, inflation was out of control. The crippled economy was further battered by prolonged and sometimes simultaneous strikes by physicians, teachers, students, truck owners, copper workers, and the small business class. A military coup overthrew Allende on September 11, 1973. As the armed forces bombarded the presidential palace, Allende reportedly committed suicide. A military government, led by General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, took over control of the country. The first years of the regime were marked by serious human rights violations. A new Constitution was approved by a highly irregular and undemocratic plebiscite characterized by the absence of registration lists, on September 11, 1980, and General Pinochet became President of the Republic for an 8-year term.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the late 1980s, the regime gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, speech, and association, to include trade union and limited political activity. The right-wing military government pursued free market economic policies. During Pinochet's nearly 17 years in power, Chile moved away from state involvement, toward a largely free market economy that saw an increase in domestic and foreign private investment. In a plebiscite on October 5, 1988, General Pinochet was denied a second 8-year term as president (56% against 44%). Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a two-chamber congress on December 14, 1989.[PARAGRAPH:2]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_CHOLA_PEDIA"> [TAB]There is very little information available regarding the origin of the Chola Dynasty. The antiquity of this dynasty is evident from the mentions in ancient Tamil literature and in inscriptions. Later medieval Cholas also claimed a long and ancient lineage to their dynasty. Mentions in the early Sangam literature (c. 150 CE) indicate that the earliest kings of the dynasty antedated 100 CE. The earliest Chola kings for whom there is tangible evidence are mentioned in the Sangam literature. Scholars generally agree that this literature belongs to the first few centuries of the common era. The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled, and at present a connected account of the history of the period cannot be derived. The Sangam literature records the names of the kings and the princes, and of the poets who extolled them. Despite a rich literature that depicts the life and work of these people, these cannot be worked into connected history.[PARAGRAPH:2]Around the 7th century, a Chola kingdom flourished in present-day Andhra Pradesh. These Telugu Cholas (or Chodas) traced their descent to the early Sangam Cholas. However, it is not known if they had any relation to the early Cholas. It is possible that a branch of the Tamil Cholas migrated north during the time of the Pallavas to establish a kingdom of their own, away from the dominating influences of the Pandyas and Pallavas. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, who spent several months in Kanchipuram during 639640 writes about the 'kingdom of Culi-ya', in an apparent reference to the Telugu Chodas.[PARAGRAPH:2]Around 850, Vijayalaya rose from obscurity to take an opportunity arising out of a conflict between Pandyas and Pallavas, captured Thanjavur and eventually established the imperial line of the medieval Cholas. The Chola dynasty was at the peak of its influence and power during the medieval period. Through their leadership and vision, kings such as Rajaraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I extended the Chola kingdom beyond the traditional limits of a Tamil kingdom.At its peak, the Chola Empire stretched from the island of Sri Lanka in the south to the Godavari basin in the north. The kingdoms along the east coast of India up to the river Ganges acknowledged Chola suzerainty. Chola navies invaded and conquered Srivijaya in the Malayan archipelago.Throughout this period, the Cholas were constantly troubled by the ever-resilient Sinhalas, who attempted to overthrow the Chola occupation of Lanka, Pandya princes who tried to win independence for their traditional territories, and by the growing ambitions of the Chalukyas in the western Deccan. This period saw constant warfare between the Cholas and these antagonists. A balance of power existed between the Chalukyas and the Cholas, and there was a tacit acceptance of the Tungabhadra River as the boundary between the two empires. However, the bone of contention between these two powers was the growing Chola influence in the Vengi kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Later Chola dynasty saw capable rulers in Kulothunga Chola I and Vikrama Chola; however, the decline of the Chola power practically started during this period. The Cholas lost control of the island of Lanka and were driven out by the revival of Sinhala power. Around 1118, they lost control of Vengi to the Western Chalukya king Vikramaditya VI and Gangavadi (southern Mysore districts) to the growing power of Hoysala Vishnuvardhana, a Chalukya feudatory. In the Pandya territories, the lack of a controlling central administration prompted a number of claimants to the Pandya throne to cause a civil war in which the Sinhalas and the Cholas were involved by proxy.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Cholas, under Rajaraja Chola III and later, his son Rajendra Chola III, experienced continuous trouble. One feudatory, the Kadava chieftain Kopperunchinga I, even held Rajaraja Chola III as hostage for sometime. At the close of the 12th century, the growing influence of the Hoysalas replaced the declining Chalukyas as the main player in the north. The local feudatories were also becoming sufficiently confident to challenge the central Chola authority. The Cholas were exposed to assaults from within and without. The Pandyas in the south had risen to the rank of a great power. The Hoysalas in the west threatened the existence of the Chola empire. Rajendra tried to survive by aligning with the two powers in turn. At the close of Rajendras reign, the Pandyan empire was at the height of prosperity and had taken the place of the Chola empire in the eyes of the foreign observers. The last recorded date of Rajendra III is 1279. There is no evidence that Rajendra was followed immediately by another Chola prince. The Chola empire was completely overshadowed by the Pandyan empire and sank into obscurity by the end of the 13th century.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_COLOMBIA_PEDIA">[TAB]Spanish explorers made the first exploration of the Caribbean littoral in 1499 led by Rodrigo de Bastidas. Christopher Columbus navigated near the Caribbean in 1502. In 1508, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa started the conquest of the territory through the region of Urabá. In 1513, he was the first European to discover the Pacific Ocean, which he called Mar del Sur (or \"Sea of the South\") and which in fact would bring the Spaniards to Peru and Chile.  Alonso de Lugo (who had sailed with Columbus) reached the Guajira Peninsula in 1500. Santa Marta was founded in 1525, and Cartagena in 1533. Gonzalo Jiminez de Quesada led an expedition to the interior in 1535, and founded the \"New City of Granada,\" the name soon changed to \"Santa Fé de Bogotá.\" Two other notable journeys by Spaniards to the interior took place in the same period. Sebastian de Belalcazar, conqueror of Quito, traveled north and founded Cali in 1536 and Popayan in 1537; Nicolas Federman crossed Llanos Orientales and went over the Eastern Cordillera.  The territory's main population was made up of hundreds of tribes of the Chibchan and Carib, currently known as the Caribbean people, whom the Spaniards conquered through warfare and alliances, while resulting disease such as smallpox, and the conquest and ethnic cleansing itself caused a demographic reduction among the indigenous people.  In the sixteenth century, Europeans began to bring slaves from Africa.  Since the beginning of the periods of Conquest and Colonization, there were several rebel movements under Spanish rule, most of them either being crushed or remaining too weak to change the overall situation. The last one which sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around 1810, following the independence of St. Domingue in 1804 (present-day Haiti), who provided a non-negligible degree of support to the eventual leaders of this rebellion: Simón Bolívar and Francisco de Paula Santander.  A movement initiated by Antonio Nariño, who opposed Spanish centralism and led the opposition against the viceroyalty, led to the independence of Cartagena in November 1811. This led to the formation of two independent governments which fought a civil war, a period known as La Patria Boba. The following year Nariño proclaimed the United Provinces of New Granada, headed by Camilo Torres Tenorio. Despite the successes of the rebellion, the emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the liberators (federalism and centralism) gave rise to an internal clash between these two, thus contributing to the reconquest of territory by the Spanish, allowing restoration of the viceroyalty under the command of Juan de Samano, whose regime punished those who participated in the uprisings. This stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened Spain, made possible a successful rebellion led by Simón Bolívar, who finally proclaimed independence in 1819. The pro-Spanish resistance was finally defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela.  The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the Republic of Colombia organized as a union of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela (Panama was then an integral part of Colombia). The Congress of Cucuta in 1821 adopted a constitution for the new Republic. The first President of Colombia was the Venezuelan-born Simón Bolívar, and Francisco de Paula Santander was Vice President. However, the new republic was very unstable and ended with the rupture of Venezuela in 1829, followed by Ecuador in 1830.Internal political and territorial divisions led to the secession of Venezuela and Quito (today's Ecuador) in 1830. The so-called \"Department of Cundinamarca\" adopted the name \"Nueva Granada\", which it kept until 1856 when it became the \"Confederación Granadina\" (Grenadine Confederation). After a two-year civil war in 1863, the \"United States of Colombia\" was created, lasting until 1886, when the country finally became known as the Republic of Colombia. Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces, occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars, the most significant being the Thousand Days civil war (18991902).  This, together with the United States of America's intentions to influence the area (especially the Panama Canal construction and control) led to the separation of the Department of Panama in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation. The United States paid Colombia $25,000,000 in 1921, seven years after completion of the canal, for redress of President Roosevelt's role in the creation of Panama, and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the Thomson-Urrutia Treaty. Colombia was engulfed in the Year-Long War with Peru over a territorial dispute involving the Amazonas Department and its capital Leticia.  Soon after, Colombia achieved a relative degree of political stability, which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, a period known as La Violencia (\"The Violence\"). Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties, which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán on April 9, 1948. This assassination caused riots in Bogotá and became known as El Bogotazo. The violence from these riots spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 Colombians.  From 1953 to 1964 the violence between the two political parties decreased first when Gustavo Rojas deposed the President of Colombia in a coup d'état and negotiated with the guerrillas, and then under the military junta of General Gabriel París Gordillo.  After Rojas' deposition the two political parties Colombian Conservative Party and Colombian Liberal Party agreed to the creation of a \"National Front\", whereby the Liberal and Conservative parties would govern jointly. The presidency would be determined by an alternating conservative and liberal president every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices. The National Front ended \"La Violencia\", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress. In the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the FARC, ELN and M-19 to fight the government and political apparatus. These guerrilla groups were dominated by Marxist doctrines.  Emerging in the late 1970s, powerful and violent drug cartels further developed during the 1980s and 1990s. The Medellín Cartel under Pablo Escobar and the Cali Cartel, in particular, exerted political, economic and social influence in Colombia during this period. These cartels also financed and influenced different illegal armed groups throughout the political spectrum. Some enemies of these allied with the guerrillas and created or influenced paramilitary groups.  The new Colombian Constitution of 1991 was ratified after being drafted by the Constituent Assembly of Colombia. The constitution included key provisions on political, ethnic, human and gender rights. The new constitution initially prohibited the extradition of Colombian nationals, causing accusations that drug cartels had lobbied for the provision; extradition was allowed again in 1996 when the provision was repealed. The cartels had previously promoted a violent campaign against extradition, leading to many terrorist attacks and mafia-style executions. They also tried to influence the government and political structure of Colombia through corruption, as in the case of the 8000 Process scandal.  In recent years, the country has continued to be plagued by the effects of the drug trade, guerrilla insurgencies like FARC, and paramilitary groups such as the AUC, which along with other minor factions have engaged in a bloody internal armed conflict. President Andrés Pastrana and the FARC attempted to negotiate a solution to the conflict between 1999 and 2002. The government set up a \"demilitarized\" zone, but repeated tensions and crisis led the Pastrana administration to conclude that the negotiations were ineffectual. Pastrana also began to implement the Plan Colombia initiative, with the dual goal of ending the armed conflict and promoting a strong anti-narcotic strategy.  During the presidency of Álvaro Uribe, the government applied more military pressure on the FARC and other outlawed groups. After the offensive, which was supported by foreign aid provided by the United States, many security indicators improved. Reported kidnappings showed a steep decrease (from 3,700 in the year 2000 to 172 in 2009 (Jan.-Oct.)) and so did intentional homicides (from 28,837 in 2002 to 15,817 in 2009, according to police, while the health system reported a decline from 28,534 to 17,717 during the same period). Kidnappings suffered a steady decline for almost a decade until a 2010 increase saw 280 cases reported between January and October, most of which were concentrated in the Medellín area.  According to official statistics, guerrillas were reduced from 24,000 fighters in 2002 to 9,500 in 2010.  While rural areas and jungles remained dangerous, the overall reduction of violence led to the growth of internal travel and tourism after security conditions improved.  The 20062007 Colombian parapolitics scandal emerged from the revelations and judicial implications of past and present links between paramilitary groups, mainly the AUC, and some government officials and many politicians, most of them allied to the governing administration.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_CONGO_PEDIA">[TAB]The Congo Empire represents a variety of central African empires that flourished in the pre-Colonial period between 1400 and 1900.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Kingdom of Kongo (1400-1888) was an African kingdom located in west central Africa in what are now northern Angola, Cabinda, Republic of the Congo, and the western portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At its greatest extent, it reached from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Kwango River in the east, and from the Congo River in the north to the Kwanza River in the south. The kingdom consisted of several core provinces ruled by a monarch, the Manikongo (sixteenth century spelling of 'Mwene Kongo) of the Bakongo (Kongo peoples, also known as the Essikongo), but its sphere of influence extended to the neighboring states such as Ngoyo, Kakongo, Ndongo and Matamba as well. People speaking ancient versions of Kikongo probably arrived in the region from the north as part of the larger Bantu migration. They were practicing agriculture by at least 1000 BC, and working iron by at least 400 BC, though both these dates may be pushed back by more archaeological work.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Luba Empire (1585-1889) was a pre-colonial Central African state, which arose in the marshy grasslands of the Upemba depression in what is now southern Democratic Republic of Congo. The Luba Empire was founded by King Kongolo around 1585. His nephew and immediate, Kalala Ilunga, expanded the Empire over the upper left bank territories of the Lualaba River. At its peak, the state had about a million people paying tribute to its king. The Luba Empire's success was due in large part to its development of a form of a government durable enough to withstand the disruptions of succession disputes and flexible enough to incorporate foreign leaders and governments. The Luba model of governing was so successful, it was adopted by the Lunda and spread throughout the region that is today northern Angola, northwestern Zambia, and southern Democratic Republic of Congo.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Lunda Empire or Kingdom arose in the 17th century in what is now DR Congo when Ilunga Tshibinda left the Luba kingdom of his brother and married a princess from an area to the south. Their son, Mwaant Yav or Mwata Yamvo formed the central Lunda kingdom with a population of about 175,000 and became its ruler from 1660 to 1665. His title and name was passed to his descendants and successors as rulers of the kingdom. The Lunda people were able to settle and colonialize other areas and tribes, thus extending their empire to include eastern Angola, north-western Zambia and southwest Katanga Province of DR Congo.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Kuba Kingdom (1625-1900) was a pre-colonial Central African state surrounded by the Sankuru, Lulua and Kasai rivers in the southeast of what is today the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). The kingdom began as a conglomeration of several chiefdoms of various tribes and ethnic groups with no real central authority. In approximately 1625, an individual from outside the area known as Shyaam a-Mbul a Ngoong-Shyaam usurped one of the area rulers and united all the chiefdoms under his leadership. The Kuba Kingdom reached its apex during the mid 19th century. Europeans first reached the area in 1884. Because of their relative isolation, the kingdom was not as affected by the slave trade as the Kongo or Ndongo kingdoms on the coast. Toward the end of the 19th century, the kingdom was invaded by the Nsapo people. The weakened Kingdom never recovered and fractured into chiefdoms once again by the time of the Belgian Protectorate.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_CROATIA_PEDIA">[TAB]The Croats are largely Slavic people who lived in an area of what is today Galicia (in Ukraine and Poland). From there they migrated further south to present-day Croatia during the 7th century. Nominally under East Roman and then Frankish authority, Croatia eventually became a strong independent kingdom under king Tomislav in 925, but in 1102 the Croatians ended a decade-long dynastic struggle by agreeing to submit themselves to Hungarian authority.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the mid-1400s, the Hungarian kingdom was gravely hurt by the Ottoman expansion as much of the mountainous country now known as Bosnia and Herzegovina fell to the Turks. At the same time, Dalmatia became mostly Venetian. Dubrovnik was a city-state that was firstly Byzantine (Roman) and Venetian, but later, unlike other Dalmatian city-states, it became independent as Republic of Dubrovnik, even if it was often under the suzerainty of neighboring powers.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Battle of Mohács in 1526 led the Croatian Parliament to invite the Habsburgs, under Ferdinand I, to assume control over Croatia. Habsburg rule eventually did prove to be successful in thwarting the Ottomans, and by the 18th century, much of Croatia was free of Turkish control. The odd crescent shape of the Croatian lands remained as a mark, more or less, of the frontier to the Ottoman advance into Europe. Istria, Dalmatia and Dubrovnik all eventually passed to the Habsburg Monarchy between 1797 and 1815.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following World War I and the demise of Austria-Hungary, Croatia joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which became Yugoslavia in 1929). Yugoslavia was invaded during World War II and Croatia was turned into a fascist puppet-state named the Independent State of Croatia. After the defeat of the Axis powers, Yugoslavia became a federal socialist state under the strong hand of Josip Broz Tito.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1990, the first free elections were held. A people's movement called the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won, led by Franjo Tudjman General of Croatian WW2 antifascist movment, the Partisans. HDZ's intentions were to secure more independence for Croatia, contrary to the wishes of part of ethnic Serbs in the republic and official politics in Belgrade. The excessively polarized climate soon escalated into complete estrangement between the two nationalities and even sectarian violence.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the summer of 1990, Serbs from the mountainous areas where they constitute a relative majority rebelled and formed an unrecognized \"Autonomous Region of the Serb Krajina\" (later the Republic of Serbian Krajina). Any intervention by the Croatian police was obstructed by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), mainly consiteted of Serbs. The conflict culminated with the so-called \"log revolution\", when Krajina Serbs blocked the roads to the tourist destinations in Dalmatia and started a mass ethnic cleansing of all non-Serb population.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Croatian government declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, and the JNA launch an open agression on Republic and backing up local Serb militia's. Many Croatian cities, notably Vukovar and Dubrovnik, came under the attack of the Serbian forces. Croatian Parliament cut all remaining ties with Yugoslavia in October that year.[PARAGRAPH:2]The civilian population fled the areas of armed conflict en masse: generally speaking, thousands of Croats moved away from the Bosnian and Serbian border, while thousands of Serbs moved towards it. In many places, masses of civilians were forced out by the Yugoslav National Army (JNA), which consisted mostly from conscripts from Serbia and Montenegro, and irregulars from Serbia, in what became known as ethnic cleansing.[PARAGRAPH:2]The border city of Vukovar underwent a three month siege - the Battle of Vukovar - during which most of the city buildings were destroyed and a majority of the population was forced to flee. The city fell to the Serbian forces in late November 1991. Soon after, shocked with atrocites commited by Serbs, the foreign countries started recognizing Croatia's independence. By the end of January 1992, most of the world recognized the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]Subsequent UN-sponsored cease-fires followed, and the warring parties mostly entrenched. The Yugoslav People's Army retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina where war was just about to start. During 1992 and 1993, Croatia also handled seven hundred thousands of refugees from Bosnia, mainly Bosnia's Moslems.[PARAGRAPH:2]Armed conflict in Croatia remained intermittent and mostly on a small scale until 1995. In early August, Croatia started Operation Storm and Croatian Garde brigades quickly liberated most of so called Krajina, causing a mass exodus of the Serbian population. A few months later, as a result, the war ended upon the negotiation of the Dayton Agreement.[PARAGRAPH:2]President Tudjman died in late 1999 and the country underwent many liberal reforms beginning in 2000. An economic recovery as well as healing of many war wounds ensued and the country proceeded to become a member of several important regional and international organizations.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_CUBA_PEDIA">[TAB] Cuba is the most populous nation in the Caribbean. Its people, culture and customs draw from several sources including the aboriginal peoples, the period of Spanish colonialism, African slaves, and its proximity to the United States. The recorded history of Cuba began on 17 October 1492, when Christopher Columbus sighted the island during his first voyage and claimed it for Spain. The island had been inhabited by Native American peoples known as the Taíno and Ciboney whose ancestors had come from South America and possibly North and Central America in a complex series of migrations perhaps 6,000 to 8,000 years ago. The Spanish oppressed and enslaved the approximately 100,000 indigenous people that resisted conversion to Christianity on the island. Within a century, they had all but disappeared as a result of the combined effects of European-introduced disease, forced labor and other mistreatment. Cuba was in a Spanish possession for almost 400 years (circa 1511-1898). The economy was based on plantation agriculture and mining, the export of sugar, coffee and tobacco to Europe and later to North America.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the middle of the 18th century Havana, the capital city, had more than seventy thousand inhabitants, and was the third largest city in the Americas, ranking behind Lima and Mexico City but ahead of Boston and New York. There were regular proposals in the U.S. to buy Cuba from Spain. During the summer of 1848, President James K. Polk authorized his ambassador to Spain, Romulus Mitchell Saunders, to negotiate the purchase of Cuba and offer Spain up to $100 million, an astonishing sum of money at the time for one territory. Spain, however, refused. Trade in sugar and molasses was $18,000,000 in 1859 alone.[PARAGRAPH:2]A rebellion in 1868 led by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, a wealthy lawyer landowner from Oriente province who freed his slaves, proclaimed a war and was named President of the Cuban Republic-in-arms, resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the Ten Years' War between pro-independence forces and the Spanish Army. In 1879-1880, Cuban patriot Calixto Garcia attempted to start another war, known in Cuban history as \"la guerra chiquita\" (the little war) but received little support. During the 1890s, pro-independence agitation revived, fueled by resentment of the restrictions imposed on Cuban trade by Spain and hostility to Spain's increasingly oppressive and incompetent administration of Cuba. In April 1895, a new war was declared, led by the writer and poet Jose Martí who had organized the war over a ten year period while in exile in the U.S. and proclaimed Cuba an independent republic. Martí was killed at Dos Rios shortly after landing in Cuba with the eastern expeditionary force. His death immortalized him and he has become Cuba's undisputed national hero.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Republic of Cuba gained formal independence on 20 May 1902, with the independence leader Tomás Estrada Palma becoming the country's first president. During World War 1, Cuban pilots distinguished themselves fighting for France in the Lafayette Escadrille. In 1934, after a series of coups, Batista and the army, took control of the government, and in 1940, Batista decided to run for President himself. With the support of the Communist-controlled labor unions, Batista was elected President and his administration carried out major social reforms. Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration. Batista's administration formally took Cuba into World War II as a U.S. ally, declaring war on Japan on December 9, 1941, then on Germany and Italy on December 11, 1941; Cuba, however, did not significantly participate militarily in World War II hostilities. At the end of his term in 1944, in accordance with the constitution, Batista stepped down and Ramón Grau was elected to succeed him. Grau initiated increased government spending on health, education and housing. Grau's \"Auténticos\" (authentics) were bitter enemies of the Communists and Batista, which opposed most of Grau's program. Grau completed his presidential term. In 1948, Grau was succeeded by Carlos Prío Socarrás, who had been Grau's minister of labor and was particularly hated by the Communists. Corruption was believed to have increased under Prío's administration; however no accusations of corruption were ever proven, and Eduardo Chibás, leader of the Ortodoxo party to which Fidel Castro belonged, committed suicide when his allegations were not substantiated. The 1952 election was a three-way race. Roberto Agramonte of the Ortodoxos party led in all the polls, followed by Dr. Aurelio Hevia of the Auténtico party, and running a distant third was Batista, who was seeking a return to office. Both front runners, Agramonte and Hevia in their own camps, had decided to name Col. Ramon Barquin, then a diplomat in Washington, DC to head the Cuban Armed Forces after the elections. Barquin was a top officer who commanded the respect of the professional army and had promised to eliminate corruption in the ranks. Batista feared that Barquin would oust him and his followers, and when it became apparent that Batista had little chance of winning, he staged a coup on 10 March 1952.[PARAGRAPH:2]On April 4, 1956, a coup by hundreds of career officers led by Col. Barquin (then Vice Chairman of the Inter-American Defense Board in Washington and Cuban Military Attaché of Sea, Air and Land to the US) was betrayed by Rios Morejon. The coup broke the backbone of the Cuban Armed Forces. The officers were sentenced to the maximum terms allowed by Cuban Martial Law. Barquin was sentenced to solitary confinement for 8 years. \"La Conspiración de los Puros\" (the conspiracy of the pure) resulted in the imprisonment of the top commanding brass of the Armed Forces and the closing of the military academies. Barquin was the founder of La Escuela Superior de Guerra (Cuba's War College) and past director of La Escuela de Cadetes (Cuba's Military Academy). Without Barquin's officers the army's ability to combat the revolutionary insurgents was severely curtailed.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 2 December 1956, a party of 82 revolutionaries, led by Fidel Castro, landed in a yacht named Granma with the intention of establishing an armed resistance movement in the Sierra Maestra. The yacht had come from Mexico, where Castro had been exiled to, and where his army was strengthened with the help of Ernesto Che Guevara. By late 1958, and after staging many terrorist attacks, the rebels had succeeded in breaking out of the Sierra Maestra and launched a general insurrection, joined by hundreds of students and others fleeing Batista's crackdown on dissent in the cities. When the rebels captured Santa Clara, east of Havana, Batista fled the country to exile in Portugal and later Spain.  Then began the summary executions of \"suspected\" Batista collaborators and members of the opposition through the \"paredones\" ( firing squad \"wall\") that took place after show trials. Coupled with the seizure of privately-owned businesses and the rapid demise of the independent press, these atrocities raised questions about the nature of the new government. Castro, along with the hitman for hire, murderous dog, Che Guevara, executed or jailed countless innocent land and bussiness owners for the sole purpose of consolidating power and eliminating opposition. Many who had initially supported the revolution fled the country to join a rapidly growing exile community in Miami.[PARAGRAPH:2]Castro has \"successfully\" transformed Cuba into a third world nation. His \"educational\" and \"social\" programs have led to lawyers and doctors working as waiters and cab drivers in order to get some tourist tips. Pre-teen girls resort to prostitution and those lucky enough to have family abroad, can \"resolver\" (make due) better than those who don't. Hotels, beaches and hospitals, but the native Cuban would be arrested for even voicing the wish to have rights to these locations.

The Czech Republic also ranks best compared to the former Comecon members in international surveys, including the Human Development Index and quality of life.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_DENMARK_PEDIA">[TAB]From 10,000 to 1500 BC, the population of present-day Denmark evolved from a society of hunters and fishers into one of farmers. Called Jutland by the end of the 8th century, its mariners were among the Vikings, or Norsemen, who raided western Europe and the British Isles from the 9th to 11th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]The country was Christianized by Saint Ansgar and Harald Blaatand (Bluetooth) -the first Christian king- in the 10th century. Harald's son, Sweyn, conquered England in 1013. Sweyn's son, Canute the Great, who reigned from 1014 to 1035, united Denmark, England, and Norway under his rule; the southern tip of Sweden was part of Denmark until the 17th century. On Canute's death, civil war tore apart the country until Waldemar I (1157-1182) reestablished Danish hegemony over the north.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1282, the nobles won the Great Charter, and Eric V was forced to share power with parliament and a Council of Nobles. Waldemar IV (1340-1375) restored Danish power, checked only by the Hanseatic League of north German cities allied with ports from Holland to Poland. Denmark, Norway, and Sweden united under the rule of his daughter Margrethe in 1397. But Sweden later achieved autonomy and in 1523, under Gustavus I, independence.[PARAGRAPH:2]Denmark supported Napoléon, for which it was punished at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 by the loss of Norway to Sweden. In 1864, the Prussians under Bismarck and the Austrians made war on Denmark as an initial step in the unification of Germany. Denmark was neutral in World War I.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1940, Denmark was invaded by the Nazis. King Christian X reluctantly cautioned his fellow Danes to accept the occupation, but there was widespread resistance against the Nazis. Denmark was the only occupied country in World War II to save all its Jews from extermination, by smuggling them out of the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]Beginning in 1944, Denmark's relationship with its territories changed substantially. In that year, Iceland declared its independence from Denmark, ending a union that had existed since 1380. In 1948, the Faroe Islands, which had also belonged to Denmark since 1380, were granted home rule, and in 1953, Greenland officially became a territory of Denmark.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_DINNEHIH_PEDIA">[TAB]\"Dinnehih\" is the Navajo word for \"clan.\" Some scholars date the origin of native cultures in the southwestern United States to immigrants who crossed the Bering land bridge from Siberia to Alaska, approximately 10,000 BC Others maintain that native cultures came to the Americas as early as 25,000 BC These immigrants settled in what is present-day southern Utah and Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico. This culture area is contiguous with the Far West Culture, the Plains Culture (to the northeast) and the southern part of the Eastern Woodland Culture. [PARAGRAPH:2] The Southwest's climate is generally hot and arid. Much of the land is desert dotted with cacti and other water-miser plants. Some areas are characterized by plateaus, spectacular rock formations and mineral wealth. There are forests at higher elevations. The land is graced by a few green river valleys; summer rains in some areas allowed farming by peoples of remote times. [PARAGRAPH:2]Three significant cultures emerged in the region around 300 BC All three were based on a farming society augmented by hunting and gathering. They included the Anasazi, who erected cliff houses in northern Arizona and New Mexico, Utah and Colorado; the Hohokam, who dug complex irrigation systems in central Arizona; and the Mogollon, who hunted and farmed along the rivers of western New Mexico and eastern Arizona. Water was a precious natural resource in Southwestern societies, which kept strict rules about its use down to the youngest child. Some argue that these cultures were the most sophisticated of any Native American society north of present-day Mexico during the first 1,200 years AD [PARAGRAPH:2]Early ways of life had changed by the time the Spanish arrived around 1600 AD The Southwest natives survived this contact, unlike the Mayan and Aztecan cultures in Mexico that were leveled by the Spanish. In some ways, the latter's influence actually enhanced Southwest cultures for a time. Introduced tools, plants, horses and sheep exerted a positive impact on native cultures. [PARAGRAPH:2]Spaniards and later Europeans encountered three subsistence types in the Southwest: villagers, farmers and nomads as well as a mixture of the three. Villagers were descended mainly from the Anasazi. They were dubbed Pueblo (village) by the Spanish. The Pueblo subsisted by farming. They erected imposing terraced houses of adobe (dried clay), which sometimes rose to five stories. The Pueblo raised maize, squash and beans. They also raised cotton and wove it. The men wore breechcloths and blankets and the women wore blanket dresses. When the Spaniards introduced sheep to the area, the Pueblo women began to weave woolen clothing. The Zuni people lived in the area now known as western New Mexico and eastern Arizona. For hundreds of years, the Zuni were farmers and traders. The oldest continuously inhabited village in the United States is the Hopi community of Old Oraibi, located on a mesa in northern Arizona. This village came into being around 1050 AD when the Hopi migrated to this area. [PARAGRAPH:2]South of the Pueblo, other natives lived off the land. These groups include the Mojave and Yuma of the Colorado and Gila river valleys, the Pima of the southwestern Arizona desert, and the Yaqui, whose cultural roots are in Mexico. Some of these peoples were probably descended from the Hohokam of earlier times. The Mojave grew melons, pumpkin and maize, and built large houses with grass roofs covered by mud. Around 3,000 Yuma lived in the Southwest in the late 1600s. The Yuma were productive farmers in spite of the hot climate. The Pima were accomplished farmers and capitalized on the Hohokams' already large irrigation system with dams, reservoirs and some 200 miles of irrigation ditches. They developed drought-resistant maize and managed to cultivate several crops a year to barter and store. [PARAGRAPH:2]The third group included the Navajo, Apache and Hopi, among others. They probably migrated from the northwest about a millennium ago, well after other Southwestern natives had settled. When these nomadic tribes arrived, they lived by hunting. Then the Navajo settled near the Pueblo and learned to raise maize and weave cotton. After the Spaniards brought horses and sheep, the Navajo lived by raising sheep, weaving colorfully attractive blankets and crafting fine silver jewelry. They lived in a hogan, or earth lodge. The warlike Apache did not settle down. They preferred hunting and raiding; few of them raised crops. Some lived in brush huts and others lived in tipis like the Plains natives. Most of them dressed in animal skins. [PARAGRAPH:2]There were several language groups prior to European contact. They included Kerasan and Tanoan, languages of the Pueblo; Navajo, from the Athapascan linguistic family traceable to Northern Canada and Alaska; Yuman, spoken by the Havasupai and Mojave; Zuni Pueblo; and sign language, shared among the several tribes to overcome language barriers. Following European contact, the indigenous peoples acquired Spanish, English and a trader language (with whites) whose purpose was similar to sign language. In all, more than 600 native dialects were spoken among a dozen major tribes and their sub-groups. [PARAGRAPH:2]The people of the Southwest supported full-time religious leaders with shrines or temples. Most Southwestern Native Americans believed that in the universe there exists an Almighty, a formless spiritual force that is the source of all life. The sun was venerated as the power of the Almighty. They did not worship the sun, but prayed to the Almighty; the sun was its symbol. Some Southwest Native Americans believed the first people were created in a cavern below the surface of the earth. They climbed through two more caves, occupied by other living things, until they reached the surface. They emerged through a hole called sipapu, from which humans were born. They believed that this fourth world was sacred. Children listened to their parents tell legends, which recounted how people and nature work together. Catholicism was introduced by the Spanish. [PARAGRAPH:2]White contact from the 1600s onward was greedy, ruthless and marginalizing. In addition, the legacy of the Southwest Native Americans following 1845 is marred by promises made and undone by the federal government. Title rights to this region's water and mineral resources lay at the root of the confrontation between native and white cultures. In the long run, native societies were restricted to increasingly smaller reservations-most lacking access to traditional natural resources. [PARAGRAPH:2]Modern descendants of these tribes are noted for their symbol-rich spirituality, reverence for the earth, tightly knit clans, rousing dance and exquisitely rendered crafts. Water and mineral rights are an abiding concern and source of contention with the far more numerous non-natives of the Southwest. [PARAGRAPH:2] In this modification for CivIV by Wyz_sub10, the Southwest cultures include the Navajo, Apache, Hopi and Nambe groups among many others. The flag is that of the Navajo people of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona, United States.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ETRUSCANS_PEDIA">[TAB]Long before the days of Rome's greatness, Italy was the home of a people far advanced in civilization - the Etruscans, or Tyrrhenians. These people rose to prosperity and power, then almost vanished from recorded history, leaving unsolved many questions about their origin and culture.[PARAGRAPH:2]Scholars think that the Etruscans were a seafaring people from Asia Minor. As early as 1000 BC they were living in Italy in an area that was roughly equivalent to modern Tuscany, from the Tiber River north almost to the Arno River. Later their rule embraced a large part of western Italy, including Rome. When the Tarquin Dynasty was expelled from Rome about 500 BC, Lars Porsena, king of Etruria and Clusium, sought to reestablish his influence over Rome.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Etruscans already controlled the commerce of the Tyrrhenian Sea on their western border. After losing control of Rome, they strengthened their naval power through an alliance with Carthage against Greece. In 474 BCtheir fleet was destroyed by the Greeks of Syracuse. From that time their power rapidly declined. The Gauls overran the country from the north, and the Etruscans' strong southern fortress of Veii fell to Rome after a ten-year seige (396 BC). The Etruscans were absorbed by the Romans, who adopted many of their advanced arts, their customs, and their institutions.[PARAGRAPH:2]Because little Etruscan literature remains and the language of inscriptions on their monuments has been only partially deciphered, scholars have gained most of their knowledge of the Etruscans from studying the remains of their city walls, houses, monuments, and tombs. Weapons and other implements, exquisite jewelry, coins, statues of stone, bronze, and terra-cotta, and black pottery (called bucchero) have been found. Grecian and Oriental influences are seen in this art.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_FINLAND_PEDIA">[TAB]According to archaeological evidence, the area now comprising Finland was first settled around 8500 BC during the Stone Age as the ice shield of the last ice age receded. The earliest people were probably hunter-gatherers, living primarily off what the tundra and sea could offer. Pottery is known from around 5300 BC (see Comb Ceramic Culture). The existence of an extensive exchange system during the mesolithic is indicated by the spread of asbestos and soapstone from eastern Finland, and by finds of flint from southern Scandinavia and Russia and slate from Lake Onega and northern Scandinavia. It has been postulated and held probable that the speakers of the Finno-Ugric language arrived in the area during the Stone Age, and were possibly even among the first Mesolithic settlers [1]. The arrival of the Battle-Axe Culture (or Cord-Ceramic Culture) in southern coastal Finland around 3200 BC may have coincided with the start of agriculture. However, the earliest certain records of agriculture are from the late 3rd millennium BC Hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy, especially in the northern and eastern parts of the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]The beginning of Finland's nearly 700-year association with the Kingdom of Sweden is traditionally connected with the year 1154 and the hypothesized introduction of Christianity by Sweden's King Erik. However, archaeological evidence points to prior Christian influences in south-western and south-eastern Finland and include both western and eastern Christian artefacts. Historically (more documented), the union began upon Birger Jarl's expedition to Finland in 1249. Swedish became the dominant language of administration and education; Finnish chiefly a language for the peasantry, clergy and local courts in predominantly Finnish-speaking areas.[PARAGRAPH:2]On March 29, 1809, after being conquered by the armies of Russian Emperor Alexander I, Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy under the Russian Empire until the end of 1917. During this time, Finnish started gaining recognition by both the imperial court and the governing bodies, first probably to sever the cultural and emotional ties with Sweden and thereafter, from the 1860s onwards, as a result of a strong nationalist movement, known as the Fennoman movement. Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland's national epic, the Kalevala, in 1835; and the Finnish language achieving equal legal status with Swedish in 1892.[PARAGRAPH:2]During World War II, Finland fought the Soviet Union twice: in the Winter War of 1939-1940 and in the Continuation War of 1941-1944 in accordance with Operation Barbarossa in which Germany invaded the Soviet Union. This was followed by the Lapland War of 1944-1945, when Finland forced the Germans out of northern Finland.[PARAGRAPH:2]Treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included obligations, restraints, and reparations on Finland vis-à-vis the Soviet Union as well as further Finnish territorial concessions (cf. the Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940). Finland ceded most of Finnish Karelia, Salla, and Petsamo, which amounted to 10% of land area, 20% of industrial capacity and 400,000 evacuees. The reparations to the Soviet Union forced Finland to transform itself from a primarily agrarian economy to an industrialised one. Nevertheless, most trade was with other Western countries. Even after reparations were fulfilled, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union in the framework of bilateral trade. (Russia has assumed a large part of the Soviet national debt which is slowly being remunerated in raw materials and electricity).[PARAGRAPH:2]The post-war era was a period of rapid economic growth and increasing wealth and stability for Finland. In all, the war-ravaged agrarian country was transformed into a technologically advanced market economy with a sophisticated social welfare system. When the Soviet Union fell in 1991, the bilateral trade disappeared overnight, and Finland was simultaneously hit by a \"home-cooked\" severe recession. This left a mass unemployment problem, but the economy survived and began growing at a high rate after the recession. Finland joined the European Union in 1995, where she is an advocate of federalism contrary to the other Nordic countries that are predominantly supportive of confederalism.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_GEORGIA_PEDIA">[TAB]Evidence for the earliest occupation of the territory of present day Georgia goes back to ca. 1.8 million years ago, as evident from the excavations of Dmanisi in the south-eastern part of the country. Later prehistoric remains (Acheulian, Mousterian and the Upper Palaeolithic) are known from numerous cave and open-air sites in Georgia. The earliest agricultural Neolithic occupation is dated sometime between 6000 and 5000 B.C. known as the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, where people used local obsidian for tools, raised animals such as cattle and pigs, and grow crops, including grapes.[PARAGRAPH:2]The history of Georgia can be traced back to the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia, and it was one of the first countries to adopt Christianity as an official religion, early in the 4th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Between 2100 and 750 B.C., the area survived the invasions by the Hittites, Urartians, Medes, Proto-Persians and Cimmerians.The first two Georgian states emerged in the west known as the Kingdom of Colchis and in the east as the Kingdom of Iberia.[PARAGRAPH:2]A second Georgian tribal union emerged in the 13th century BC on the Black Sea coast under the Kingdom of Colchis in western Georgia.The ancient Greeks knew of Colchis, and it featured in the Greek legend of Jason and the Argonauts, who travelled there in search of the Golden Fleece. In the eastern part of Georgia there was a struggle for the leadership among the various Georgian confederations during the 6th  4th centuries BC which was finally won by the Kartlian tribes from the region of Mtskheta. According to the Georgian tradition, the Kingdom of Kartli (known as Iberia in the Greek-Roman literature) was founded around 300 BC by Parnavaz I, the first ruler of the Parnavazid dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:2] At the beginning of the 19th century Georgia became a part of the Russian Empire. After a brief period of independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Georgia was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1922.[PARAGRAPH:2]Independence was restored in 1991. Like many post-communist countries Georgia suffered from the economic crisis and civil unrest during the 1990s. After the bloodless Rose Revolution, however, the new leadership has established efficient government institutions, reformed the economy and guided the country through a period of the fastest economic growth in its history.[PARAGRAPH:2]Georgia is a representative democracy, organized as a secular, unitary semi-presidential republic; however the idea to restore the constitutional monarchy is popular in certain circles, most notably in the Georgian Orthodox Church It is currently a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, and GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development. The country seeks to join NATO and, in the longer term, accession to the European Union.[PARAGRAPH:2]In August 2008, Georgia engaged in an armed conflict with Russia and separatist groups from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In the aftermath of the conflict Russia recognized the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states, but at present only Nicaragua, the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, and the de facto independent republic of Transnistria have followed suit. On August 28, 2008, the Parliament of Georgia passed a resolution declaring Abkhazia and South Ossetia \"Russian-occupied territories\".</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_GETAI_PEDIA">[TAB]At the end of the Aeneolithic Age, around 3500 BC, an important ethnic and cultural synthesis took place that led to the appearance of new peoples and cultures in Central Europe and the Balkans. These peoples can be identified with the traditional ethnic groups of Old Europe: the Hellenes, the Illyrioi, and the Thraikes. The Thraikes came to inhabit the vast territory from the south of Poland, to the north of Hellas and from Slovakia to north-western Anatolia. The Hellenic historians related that \"The population of Thraike is greater than that of any other country in the world except India. If the Thraikes could be united under a single ruler in a homogenous whole, they would be the most powerful nation on earth and no one could cope with them.\"[PARAGRAPH:2]The next historical period, the Bronze Age ( 3500 to 1200 BC) also includes the development of the Thraikes. A spectacular demographic growth occurred, as proven by archeological discoveries of many large settlements, some of them fortified. The metallurgy practiced in Bronze Age Getia, although not of local region, attained high levels as evidenced by the rich deposits of bronze items found in parts of Transylvania. Along the tribal aristocracy, a class of priests may have also existed.Their rituals ware preformed in sanctuaries. The lower classes engaged in mining, metallurgy, handicrafts,agriculture and commercial activities.[PARAGRAPH:2]Beginning in 1400 BC, important ethnic and cultural developments took place in the Carpathian-Danubian territory. Nomadic tribes from the Sabatinovka culture moved towards the west while the creators of the mound tomb culture (hugelgraber-kultur) came from the regions of central Europe toward the east and southeast, causing the dislocation of some Thracian tribes and the massive movement of peoples toward southeastern Europe, to north-eastern Anatolia and beyond to Aigyptos, Phoinikia, Syria, and Palestine. Being in contact with advanced civilizations, such as those of the Hellenes,Persai,and Makedonians, the southern tribes of the Thraikes experienced a more rapid development.  However,those living north, including the Getai, had a slower development, due in part to the continuing invasion of nomadic tribes.[PARAGRAPH:2]As Strabo records: \"the Getai are those who occupy the territory toward the sea and the east, while the Dakoi are those who live in the opposite part toward Germania and the source of the Donaris.\" Despite this they spoke the same language and belonged to the same ethnical group. The last phase of the first Iron Age (650 to the latter half of the fifth century BC) and the first two phases of the second Iron Age (the latter half of the fifth century BC to the beginning of the second century BC) denote a distinct historical period in the evolution of these northern Thraikes. They were still divided, passing through stages of political development that differed from region to region. They were greatly influenced by the people with whom they came in contact.[PARAGRAPH:2]One such people, the Hellenes, founded in the mid-seventh century BC several colonies (apoikia) and commercial settlements (emporia) such as Histria on the shore of Lake Sinoe, Tomis (today Constanta), Argamon, Kallatis (today Mangalia), and Tyras (today Cetatea Alba), on the western and northern shores of the Black Sea. These settlements belonging to the \"Hellenes beyond the seas\" played a vital role in the development of the Getai and Skythai due to their multiple economic contacts, political relationships, cultural developments, and economic exchanges with the local communities. Close relationships formed between the Getai and Hellenes that led to the gradual Hellenization of the native tribes. Hellenic ceramic goods, luxury items, and superior oils and wines spread throughout Dobrogea and beyond to Moldavia, Muntenia, and Oltenia. Rapid cultural progress took place. Some tribes, including the Getai, founded powerful political organizations led by dynasts during the sixth to the third centuries BC. Herodotos relates in his \"Histories\" that during the expedition led by the Persai King Dareios I against the Skythai north of the Black Sea, in the year 513 the Getai resisted the advance of the Persian Army, but were enslaved though they \"were the most manly and law-abiding of the tribes of the Thraikes.\" Later, Thoukydides speaks of the same Getai fighting alongside the Odrysian King Sitalkes adgainst the allies of Athenai in the Peloponesian War of 429 BC.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philippos II of Makedonia, in order to punish the Skythai king Ateas for his treachery, concluded an alliance with the Getic King Kothelas. This alliance was consecrated by the marriage of Kothelas's daughter Meda to Philippos in 339 BC. The Getai and Makedones drove the Skythai from Kallatis and Kothelas became the master of the Black Sea colonies. Philippos's son, Megas Alexandros, undertook an expedition against the Triballoi in the year 335 BC, in preparation for his great Persian campaign. The legendary general defeated the Triballoi and made a brief expedition north of the Istros (Danube) against the Getai who mustered an army of 4,000 horseman and 10,000 infantry. The peace was short-lived, however, as around 325 BC the military governor of Thraike was killed together with his entire army by a Getic-Skythian combined force.[PARAGRAPH:2]This victory, combined with the death of Megas Alexandros in 323 BC, weakened Makedonian control in the region and allowed the Getai to become the dominant political factor in the region. The tribes offered vital assistance to the Hellenic colonies on the Black Sea coast, led by Kallatis in their struggle against the Makedonian Lysimachos, the King of Thraike. But the most important episode, related by several ancient authors (Diodoros Sikilios, Strabo, and Trogus Pompeius) was the conflict between Lysimachos and the Getian kingdom of Dromichaites. The kingdom of Dromichaites was located in Eastern Muntenia, having its capital at Helis (Piscul Crasanii). The Makedonian king tried to make Donaris his northern frontier, while the Getian tried to mentain his control over the colonies on the Black Sea coast. Lysimachos organized two campaigns north of the Istros, in 300 and 292 BC. The result was a military disaster as both Lysimachos and his heir Agathokles ware captured. The Makedones finally recognized Getic supremacy over the lower Istros and Black Sea. A royal marriage concluded the alliance between the two powers. Two Getic rulers (Zalmodegikos and later Rhemaxos) continued to exercise control of Histria. Around the year 200 BC King Oroles from southern Moldavia opposed the advance of the Bastarnai. Another king, Rubobostes, ended the Celtic domination in Transylvania. The Getai aquired significant political experience and this allowed them to become the most advanced \"barbaroi\" in the centuries to come as they made the transition from tribal society to a state society.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the middle of the second century BC the Geto-Dacians entered a new period of development, the most advanced in their entire history. The most interesting part of this period is the apppereance of proto-urban settlements known as davas. They were organized areas, being political, commercial, religious and military centers of the dacian tribes. Some used Roman, Celtic or Hellenic techniques known as Murus Dacicus. The Dacian fortresses found north of the Danube, like the complex of fortifications in the Sebes mountaines, formed the strongest defensive systems in the \"barbarian\" world. The Getian craftsmen had ties with the Roman and Hellenic worlds, which brought an unprecedented level of economic development. The Dacian goldsmiths even exported to far-off Scandinavia. The society becomes clearly divided into two social groups: the cometai (the free people) and tarabostes (the nobility). The leaders of state were elected from the nobility, which was distinguishable by the fur caps. A class of priests developed to serve as intermediaries between god and man. This was part of the transition to the cult of Zalmoxis, which became fully incorporated into the state structure. Like noblemen, priests wore fur caps to express their position. The high priest was an important position second only to the king. It was this cult that allowed the unification of the Getian tribes to occur.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the first century BC they were finally united under the rule of King Burebista (70-44 BC). As his power increased, he opposed Roman supremacy north of the Balkans. He is referred to by the people of Dionysopolis as \"the first and the most powerful among the kings who ever reigned in Thraike, master of the entire region this side of the great river.\" His kingdom centered at Arcidava gradually expanded in all directions. Getian armies crushed the Boioi and Tauriskoi in the winter campaign of 60 BC. He later (in 55 BC) conquered the Hellenic colonies on the Black Sea coast, defeating the Bastarnai and securing the shoreline from Olbia in the north to Apollonia in the south. Now Getia was a force to be reckoned with. Previous military succeses inspired the Getai to mount a campaign south of the Istros around 48 BC. The result of this was contact between the Roman and Getian worlds. Burebista could afford to interfere in the Roman civil war by supporting Pompey in his struggle against Julius Caesar. Thus, the Getians were now united against a common foe. When the threat of an invasion ended with the death of Caesar on the Ides of March in 44 BC, the sense of national unity collapsed, as the tarabostes assassinated Burebista. His succesor, the high priest Deceneus, failed to keep the tribes in line. In the following decades four minor kingdoms emerged from the civil war and none of them was individually strong enough to halt the Roman advance in the Balkans.[PARAGRAPH:2]A capable strategist, diplomat and politician, King Decebalus united the Getians once more under his rule (87-106 AD). He introduced a centralized administrative system, which led to the development of the most well-organized barbarian states in the first century AD. The fledgeling Dacian state became a menace to Roman authority as Decebal mobilized the tribes in a raid against the Roman garrisons of Moesia Inferior in 87 AD. Oppius Sabinus, the Roman governor, along with his entire legion, were slain. He later repelled the Roman counter-offensive led by Cornelius Fuscus, capturing the Roman eagle. The line of victories ended at Tapae, where the Roman army of Tetitus Iulianus finally defeated the raiders. The Roman Emperor Domitian was forced however to conclude a peace treaty with the Dacians in 89 AD. Dacia became a client kingdom and received Roman war machines, engineers and even financial assistance to improve the Dacian fortresses. When Marcus Ulpius Traianus became emperor in 98 AD, he decided to eliminate the Dacian kingdom. Apart from desire for vengeance, the new ruler needed to secure his flank along the Istros and gain the rich gold mines of the Apuseni mountains.[PARAGRAPH:2]The result was a series of Dacio-Roman wars (AD 101-102, 105-106), at the end of which Dacia would become a Roman province, bringing about the end of Zalmoxianism. The emperor's 150,000 men from Illyria and Moesia crossed a bridge of boats at Berzovia. The Getai suffered a crushing defeat at Tapae. Only the break of winter halted the Romans from reaching the Getian capital of Sarmisegetuza. In the spring the Dacians aided by Roxolani Sauromatai went on the offensive to relieve their capital. They failed as the Romans defeated them at Tropaeum Traiani and Nicopolis. Decebalus sued for peace. The peace terms ware so humiliating for the Dacians that a new conflict was inevitable. Three years later the conflict broke out as Decebal refused to dismantle his fortresses. Marching his troops on the bridge across the Danube, Trajan reached the walls of Sarmisegetuza a second time. The capital fell to the Romans and Decebalus was forced to retreat north. Pursued by Roman cavalry the king chose to commit suicide, rather than fall prisoner. Getia was no more; Rome became the sole authority in the Carpatho-Danubian region. Their colonists later merged with the shattered tribes to form the Romanian people of today.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_GOTHS_PEDIA">[TAB]The Goths orginated from Scandinavia (more particularly, Gotland or Götaland; Jordanes' Scandza). In about 1st century BC they would have become separated from related tribes, the Gutar (Gotlanders) and the Götar (Geats), which are sometimes included in the term Goths. They settled in modern-day Poland (regions East Pommern and Kuyavia, Jordanes' Gothiscandza) and mixed with local population forming Wielbark culture. They slowly migrated along the Wisla river (Vistula, Weichsel) during the 1st century , settling in Scythia (modern day Ukraine), which they called Oium \"waterlands\", where in 2nd century they formed multiethnical kingdom. Apart from Goths, it included Alans and probably Slavic people. [PARAGRAPH:2]According to legendary accounts, the capital of this kingdom was Arheimar (\"the river house\"), at the Dniepr. In 3rd Century Goths split into two groups, the Tervingi (\"Forest Goths\") or Visigoths (\"West Goths\") west of Dniester, and the Greuthungi (\"Steppe Goths\") or Ostrogoths (\"East Goths\") east of it. The Visigoths launched one of the first major \"barbarian\" invasions of the Roman Empire from 263, sacking Byzantium in 267. A year later, they suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Naissus and were driven back across the Danube River by 271. This group then settled north of the Danube and established an independent kingdom centered on the abandoned Roman province of Dacia. Both the Ostrogoths and Visigoths became heavily Romanized during the 4th century by the influence of trade with the Byzantines, and by their membership in a military covenant centered in Byzantium to assist each other militarily. They converted to Arianism during this time, which was later a reason for animosity between Goths and catholic Franks, Byzantines and conquered roman polulation. [PARAGRAPH:2]Hun domination of the Ostrogoth kingdom began in the 370s, and under pressure of the Huns, Visigothic king Fritigern in 376 asked Valens to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the Danube. Valens permitted this, and even helped the Goths cross the river, probably at the fortress of Durostorum, but following a famine the Gothic War (377-382) erupted, and Valens was killed at the Battle of Adrianople. The Visigoths under Alaric I sacked Rome in 410. Honorius granted the Visigoths Aquitania, where they defeated the Vandals and by 475 ruled most of the Iberian peninsula. The Ostrogoths in the meantime freed themselves of government of the Huns following the Battle of Nedao in 454. At the behest of emporor Zeno, Theoderic the Great from 488 conquered all of Italy. The Goths were briefly reunited under one crown in the early sixth century under Theodoric the Great, who became regent of the Visigothic kingdom following the death of Alaric II at the Battle of Vouillé in 507. The Ostrogothic kingdom persisted until 553 under Teia, when Italy briefly fell back under Byzantine control, until the conquest of the Langobards in 572. The Visigothic kingdom lasted longer. Driven from the north of Pyrenees by Franks after the Battle of Vouillé, Visigoths ruled most of the Iberian Pennisula. The last Arian Visigothic king, Liuvigild, conquered the Suevi kingdom in 585 and most of the northern regions (Cantabria) in 574 and regained part of the southern areas lost to the Byzantines, which his heir Reccared conquered completely in 624. [PARAGRAPH:2]In January 587 Reccared renounced Arianism for Catholicism and after a short civil war converted whole kingdom to catholicism. Catholic bishops increased in power, and at the synod held at Toledo in 633, they took upon themselves the nobles' right to select a king from among the royal family. In 654 The Visigothic Code of Law (forum judicum) which had been part of aristocratic oral tradition, was set in writing . It goes into more detail than a modern constitution commonly does and reveals a great deal about Visigothic social structure. The laws combine the Catholic Church's Canon law, and has a strongly theocratic tone. In 711 King Roderic (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing an invasion from the south by the Umayyad Muslims in the Battle of Guadalete on July 19. This marked the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Iberia in which most of peninsula came under Islamic rule by 718. A Visigothic nobleman, Pelayo, is credited with beginning the Christian Reconquista of Iberia in 718, when he defeated the Umayyads in battle and established the Kingdom of Asturias (that kept for a while the name Gothia) in the northern part of the peninsula. It was the beginning of modern-day Spain. Some of the Ostrogoths, on the other hand, remained at the Black Sea, and formed principality around Doros (modern Mangup) in southern Crimea. While initially Arian, they converted in V century to catholicsm and after it split followed the eastern path. The principality was a vassal of different powers (Byzantium, Khazars, Kievan Rus, Mongols, Genoa) until finally in XVI century it was incorporated into Ottoman Empire. The gothic communites survived until late XVII century, when many were deported by Catherine the Great. Their language vanished by the 1800's.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_HARAPPA_PEDIA">[TAB] The earliest traces of civilization in the Indian subcontinent can be found along the Indus River.  The first excavations of this Indus Valley Civilization, or Harappan Civilization, were conducted in 1921 in the ancient cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.  Both of these sites show examples of a highly sophisticated civilization that first developed some 4,500 - 5,000 years ago.  The Indus Valley people were most likely Dravidians, who may have been pushed down into southern India when the Aryans, with their more advanced military technology, commenced their migrations to India around 2,000 BC.  Though the Indus Valley script has yet to be deciphered, the numerous seals, statuary, potter, and cities of the Indus Valley have enabled scholars to construct a realistic account of the Indus Valley Civilization. [PARAGRAPH: 1] A centralized state and extensive town planning is suggested by the layout of the great cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.  The same kind of burnt brick appears to have been used in many cities that were hundreds of miles apart.  The weights and measures show a substantial regularity.  The Indus Valley people domesticated animals and harvested various crops, such as cotton, sesame, peas, and barley.  They may also have been seafaring people, as Indus Valley seals have been found in places such as Sumer.  However, the Indus Valley Civilization appears to have been extensively urban, challenging the former idea of India as an agricultural civilization.  The Indus Valley people had a merchant class that, as data suggests, engaged in widespread trading. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Neither Harappa nor Mohenjo-Daro show any evidence of fire altars, and as a result one can reasonably surmise that the various rituals around the fire which are important in Hinduism were brought in by the Aryans.  The Indus Valley people do not appear to have been in ownership of horses, as Harappan seals and terracotta do not show any evidence of horses.  Other than the excavated ruins of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, these seals provide the most detailed hints on the personality and culture of the Indus Valley people.  Bulls and elephants do appear on the seals, yet the horned bulls still cannot be associated with Shiva's bull in Hinduism.  The revered cow of Hinduism also does not appear on the Harappan seals.  The women portrayed on the seals wear elaborate clothing in heavy jewelry.  This suggests that the Indus Valley people were sophisticated people with cultured tastes in an advanced artistic feeling. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The Indus Valley civilization raises many unresolved questions.  Why did this civilization, considering its sophistication, not spread beyond the Indus Valley?  The area where the Indus Valley Civilization developed is arid, and one can surmise that urban development took place along a river that flowed through a virtual desert.  There are also question about the disappearance of the Indus Valley cities.  In the Rig Veda there is mention of a Vedic war god, Indra, destroying some forts and citadels, which could have included Harappa and other Indus Valley cities.  However, most of the evidence concerning the cities' disappearance is based on the arrival of the Aryans in India.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_HUNGARY_PEDIA">[TAB] Before the birth of Christ, Hungary belonged to the Roman Empire.  In the 5th century A.D., the Huns swept in from the east.  Later, Slavic and Germanic people settled in the region.  Hungarians usually trace their history to the Magyars, who under Arpad, arrived at the Danube basin.  A nomadic tribe of expert horsemen, the Magyars were excellent warriors who dominated the entire region, going as far as laying siege to German cities and Byzantium. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Under the Hungarian king Saint Stephen, Hungary was united under powerful nobles.  Hungary and Croatia were joined in 1091 and became the strongest state in east central Europe.  However, the power declined, and was forced to go under the power of the nobles.  In 1242, the Mongols invaded and devastated the land.  Most of Hungary's rulers were foreigners, with one distinguished king.  Under the king Louis the Great, Hungary reached its greatest territorial expansion.  However, the Ottoman Empire posed a threat to Hungary, who began slowly pushing on Hungary's borders.  Under Matthias Corvinus and his father Janos Hunyadi, the Ottomans were pushed from Hungary and order was restored. [PARAGRAPH: 2] With the death of Matthias, Hungary fell once again into disorder, and went under the control of the Turks.  In the 17th century, the Turks were driven out by Austria, who ruled harshly against the Hungarians.  Thus, they revolted several times, one of the most prominent being that under Lajos Kossuth.  This rebellion attempt was crushed when the Austrians received aid from Russia. The Compromise of 1867 created the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary, which gave Hungary its own parliament.  However, it was ruled by the Austrian emperor Francis Joseph I, who was crowned King of Hungary. [PARAGRAPH: 2] In World War I, Hungary fought on the side of Austria and Germany, and a revolution after the war made Hungary a republic.  After World War I, Hungary lost much of its land that it hoped to regain in World War II.  However, it was under German occupation in 1944, which were driven out by the Soviet troops.  Following the elections in 1945, Hungary became a republic.  However, under the influence of the Soviets, Hungary became Communist that ruled the country harshly.  After several successful attempts to take over the government and make reforms, Soviet troops entered Hungary to restore Communism.  By 1989, Hungary was seeing major governmental reforms.  In 1990, Soviet troops began their departure from Hungary, ending the era and starting a new one.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_HUNS_PEDIA">[TAB]The Hunnic Empire stretched from the steppes of Central Asia into modern Germany, and from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Huns were an early confederation of Central Asian equestrian nomads or semi-nomads, with a Turkic core of aristocracy. Some of these Eurasian tribes moved into Europe in the 4th and 5th centuries, most famously under Attila the Hun. Huns remaining in Asia are recorded by neighboring peoples to the south, east, and west as having occupied Central Asia roughly from the 4th century to the 6th century, with some surviving in the Caucasus until the early 8th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Modern genetic and ethnogenesis scholarship contrasts with traditional theories based on Chinese records, archaeology, linguistics and other indirect evidence. These older theories contain various elements: that the name \"Hun\" first described a nomadic ruling group of warriors whose ethnic origins were in Central Asia, and was most likely in present day Mongolia; that possibly they were related to, or part of, the Xiongnu; that the Xiongnu were defeated by the Chinese Han Empire; and that this is why they left Mongolia and moved west, eventually invading Europe 200 years later. Indirect evidence includes the transmission of grip laths for composite bows from Central Asia to the west. This narrative is ingrained in western (and eastern) historiography, but the evidence is often indirect or ambiguous. The Huns left practically no written records. There is no record of what happened between the time they left China and arrived in Europe 150 years later. The last mention of the northern Xiongnu was their defeat by the Chinese in 151 at the lake of Barkol, after which they fled to the western steppe at Kangju, Chinese records between the 3rd and 4th century suggest that a small tribe called Yueban, remnants of northern Xiongnu, was distributed about the steppe of Kazakhstan. One recent line of reasoning favors a political and cultural link between the Huns and the Xiongnu. The Central Asian sources of the 4th century translate \"Huns\" as \"Xiongnu\", and \"Xiongnu\" as \"Huns\"; also, Xiongnu and Hunnic cauldrons are virtually identical, and were buried on the same spots (river banks) in Hungary and in the Ordos.[PARAGRAPH:2]There is a theory, the turkic theory, that claims that the Huns may be of Turkic (or pre-Proto-Turkic) origin. This school of thought emerged when Joseph de Guignes in the 18th century identified the Huns with the Xiongnu or (H)siung-nu. It is supported by O. Maenchen-Helfen on the basis of his linguistic studies. English scholar Peter Heather called the Huns \"the first group of Turkic, as opposed to Iranian, nomads to have intruded into Europe\". Turkish researcher Kemal Cemal bolsters this assertion by showing similarities in words and names in Turkic and Hunnic languages, and similarities in systems of governance of Hunnic and Turkic tribes. Hungarian historian Gyula Nemeth also supports this view. Uyghur historian Turghun Almas has suggested a link between the Huns and the Uyghurs, a Turkic speaking people who reside in Xinjiang, China.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, the Huns appeared in Europe in the 4th century, apparently from Central Asia. They first appeared north of the Black Sea, forcing a large number of Goths to seek refuge in the Roman Empire; later, the Huns appeared west of the Carpathians in Pannonia, probably sometime between 400 and 410, perhaps triggering the massive migration of Germanic tribes westward across the Rhine in December 406.[PARAGRAPH:2]The establishment of the 5th century Hunnic Empire marks a historically early instance of horseback migration. Under the leadership of Attila the Hun, the Huns achieved hegemony over several rivals by using the composite bow, their highly maneuverable hit-and-run tactics with their horsemanship, and a well-organized system of taxation. Supplementing their wealth by plundering wealthy Roman cities to the south, the Huns maintained the loyalties of a number of tributary tribes.[PARAGRAPH:2]Attila's Huns incorporated groups of unrelated tributary peoples. In Europe, Alans, Gepids, Scirii, Rugians, Sarmatians and Gothic tribes all united under the Hun by Ardaric's coalition at the Battle of Nedao in 454, at modern day Nedava.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many nations have tried to assert themselves as ethnic or cultural successors to the Huns. For instance, the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans may indicate that they believed themselves to have been descended from Attila. The Bulgars certainly were part of the Hun tribal alliance for some time, and some have hypothesized that the Chuvash language (which is believed to have descended from the Bulgar language) is the closest surviving relative of the Hunnic language. The Magyars (Hungarians) also have laid claims to Hunnic heritage. Because the Huns who invaded Europe represented a loose coalition of various peoples, it is possible that Magyars were part of it. Until the early 20th century, many Hungarian historians believed that the Székely people were the descendants of the Huns. In 2005, a group of about 2,500 Hungarians petitioned the government for recognition of minority status as direct descendants of Attila. The bid failed, but gained some publicity for the group, which formed in the early 1990s and appears to represent a special Hun(garian)-centric brand of mysticism. The self-proclaimed Huns are not known to possess any distinctly Hunnic culture or language beyond what would be available from historical and modern-mystical Hungarian sources.[PARAGRAPH:2]While it is clear that the Huns left descendants all over Eastern Europe, the disintegration of the Hun Empire meant they never regained their lost glory. One reason was that the Huns never fully established the mechanisms of a state, such as bureaucracy and taxes, unlike the Magyars or Golden Horde. Once disorganized, the Huns were absorbed by more organized polities.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_HURRIANS_PEDIA">[TAB] Like many aspects of Hurrian culture, their origins are still a mystery.  By 2400 BC, the Hurrians may have expanded from the foothills of the Caucasus to northern Mesopotamia.  The Khabur River Valley became the heart of the Hurrian lands for a millennium.  The first known Hurrian kingdom was centered on the city of Urkesh during the third millennium BC.  The end of the Akkadian Empire enabled the Hurrians to gain control of the area.  Now the Hurrians could benefit from the previous wealthy cultures living there and organize their own advanced city-state.  Urkesh had some powerful neighbors.  Their neighbors included the powerful Amorite kingdom of Mari and the capital of an Old Assyrian kingdom called Shubat-Enlil was founded some distance from Urkesh at another Hurrian settlement in the Khabur River Valley. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The Hurrians also migrated west, and by 1725 BC their remnants can be found in northern Syria.  Early Hurrian kingdoms, such as Kizzuwatna, flourished during this time.  However, many of them eventually found themselves subdued by the Hittites, whom were influenced by the Hurrian culture for centuries.  The destruction of the Babylonian kingdom by the Hittites allowed a powerful Hurrian dynasty to rise.  A legendary king, Kirta, founded the kingdom of Mitanni around 1500 BC.  Mitanni gradually grew from the region around the Khabur Valley and became the most powerful kingdom of the Near East in the 1400s and 1300s BC. [PARAGRAPH: 1] King Barattarna of Mitanni expanded the Mitanni kingdom greatly, and the nation grew even stronger under the reign of Shaushtatar.  Other Hurrian kingdoms, such as Kizzuwatna and Ishuwa, proved powerful allies against the hostile Hittites.  Several wars with the Pharaohs over the control of Syria caused the Mitanni and Egyptians to form an alliance.  During Shaushtatar's reign, Mitanni grew to its zenith.  After the death of Shuttarna, Mitanni was ravaged by a war of succession.  After a king finally claimed the throne, Mitanni had been weakened considerably.  At this same time, both the Hittite and Assyrian power increased, bringing a greater thread to Mitanni.  In the capital Washukanni a new power struggle broke out.  Eventually, after wars with the Hittites and Assyrians, Mitanni was weakened greatly and was eventually annexed by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser in the 13th century BC. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Another Hurrian kingdom also benefited from the demise of Babylonian power in the sixteenth century BC.  The Hurrians now inhabited the region northeast of the Tigris River.  The kingdom that emerged here was Arrapha.  Excavations at one of Arrapha's chief cities, Nuzi, proved to be an important source of information about the Hurrians.  Eventually, this kingdom was destroyed by the Assyrians in the fourteenth century BC. [PARAGRAPH: 1] By the thirteenth century BC, all the Hurrian states had been vanquished by other peoples.  The heart of the Hurrian lands, the Khabur River Valley, became an Assyrian province.  The Hurrian population in Syria seems to have given up their language in favor the Assyrian dialect of Akkadian, or, more likely, Aramaic.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_INDONESIA_PEDIA">[TAB]The area now comprising the archipelago of Indonesia, specifically Java, was inhabited by Homo erectus approximately 500,000 years ago, while the island of Flores was home to a newly discovered species of hominid, Homo floresiensis until approximately 10,000 years ago. The date of the earliest arrival of Homo Sapiens into the area was between 40,000 and 100,000 years ago. The earliest historical mention of the area was of the Jawa Dwipa Hindu kingdom in Java and Sumatra around 200 BC by Indian scholars, and various archeological sites show the influence of the Hindu religion in the area from the first century AD to the fifth century AD.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism, several kingdoms formed on the islands of Sumatra and Java from the 7th to 14th century. The arrival of Arabs trading in spices later brought Islam, which became the dominant religion in many parts of the archipelago after the collapse of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms. When the Portuguese came in early 16th century, they found a multitude of small states, vulnerable to the Portuguese, and later other Europeans wanting to dominate the spice trade.[PARAGRAPH:2]During World War II, with the Netherlands under German occupation, Japan began a five-prong campaign in December 1941 towards Java and the vital fuel supplies of the Dutch East Indies. Though Japan captured Java by March 1942,it initially could not find any national leader willing to collaborate with the Japanese government against the Dutch. In 1945, with the war drawing to a close, Indonesian leader Sukarno was made aware of an opportunity to declare independence. In response to lobbying, Japan agreed to allow Sukarno to establish a committee to plan for independence. However, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared independence unilaterally on 17 August, soon after the Japanese lost the war. Following the defeat of Japan in the World War, the Netherlands' Army, at first backed by the British, attempted to reoccupy their former East Indies colonies. Indonesia's war for independence lasted from 1945 until 27 December 1949 when, under heavy international pressure, especially from the United States, which threatened to cut off Marshall Plan funds, the Netherlands acknowledged the independence of Indonesia as a Federation of autonomous states. This federation soon became a republic with Sukarno as president and Hatta as vice president. It was not until 16 August 2005 that the Dutch government recognized 1945 as the country's year of independence and expressed regrets over the Indonesian deaths caused by the Netherlands' Army.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 1950s and 1960s saw Sukarno's government aligned first with the emerging non-aligned movement and later with the socialist bloc. The 1960s saw Indonesia in a military confrontation against neighbouring Malaysia, and increasing frustration over domestic economic difficulties. Army general Suharto became president in 1967 on the pretext of securing the country against an alleged communist coup attempt against a weakening Sukarno, whose tilt leftward had alarmed both the military and Western powers. In the aftermath of Suharto's rise, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or imprisoned by the military and religious groups in a backlash against alleged communist supporters. Suharto's administration is commonly called the New Order era. Suharto invited major foreign investment, which produced substantial, if uneven, economic growth. However, Suharto enriched himself and his family through widespread corruption and was forced to step down amid massive popular demonstrations and a faltering economy by the Indonesian Revolution of 1998.[PARAGRAPH:2]President BJ Habibie promised a multiparty, free, democratic election in 1999. He encouraged freedom of the press. His presidency was plagued by various bloody conflicts, both long-running ones in Aceh and West Papua and new ones in Maluku, Poso (Sulawesi), and Kalimantan. There was a major financial scandal (Bank Bali case) related to his friends and the staff of his political party. On 1999, President BJ Habibie agreed to hold a referendum in East Timor. The result of the referendum was an overwhelming vote for independence from Indonesia. After the announcement of the result, there was a bloody riot in East Timor by the angry pro-Indonesia militia. The militia burned down houses, shops, schools, churches and government buildings. Hundreds of people were killed. The UN sent a peace keeping force to East Timor. The UN Human Rights Commission alleged that several Indonesian government staff and military officers were responsible for the riot. The Indonesian Human Rights Court freed all but one suspect. The only suspect punished for the human rights violation during the riot was Enrico Gutierrez, a former leader of the pro-Indonesia militia.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_IRAN_PEDIA">[TAB]Iran, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran and formerly known internationally as Persia until 1935, is a country in Central Eurasia,located on the northeastern shore of the Persian Gulf, northwestern shore of the Gulf of Oman, and the southern shore of the Caspian Sea. Both \"Persia\" and \"Iran\" are used interchangeably in cultural context; however, Iran is the name used officially in political context. The name Iran is a cognate of Aryan, and means \"Land of the Aryans\".[PARAGRAPH:2]Iran is home to one of the world's oldest continuous major civilizations, with historical and urban settlements dating back to 7000 BC. The first Iranian dynasty formed during the Elamite kingdom in 2800 BC. The Iranian Medes unified Iran into an empire in 625 BC. They were succeeded by three Iranian Empires, the Achaemenids, Parthians and Sassanids, which governed Iran for more than 1000 years. Iranian post-Islamic dynasties and empires expanded the Persian language and culture throughout the Iranian plateau. Early Iranian dynasties which re-asserted Iranian independence included the Tahirids, Saffarids, Samanids and Buyids. The blossoming of Persian literature, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, mathematics and art became major elements of Muslim civilization and started with the Saffarids and Samanids. Iran was once again reunified as an independent state in 1501 by the Safavid dynasty  who promoted Twelver Shi'a Islam as the official religion of their empire, marking one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam. \"Persia's Constitutional Revolution\" established the nation's first parliament in 1906, within a constitutional monarchy. Iran officially became an Islamic republic on 1 April 1979, following the Iranian Revolution.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Iranian Revolution, also known as the Islamic Revolution, began in January 1978 with the first major demonstrations against the Shah. After strikes and demonstrations paralysed the country and its economy, the Shah fled the country in January 1979 and Ayatollah Khomeini returned from exile to Tehran. The Pahlavi Dynasty collapsed ten days later, on 11 February, when Iran's military declared itself \"neutral\" after guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting. Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on 1 April 1979 when Iranians overwhelmingly approved a national referendum to make it so. In December 1979, the country approved a theocratic constitution, whereby Khomeini became Supreme Leader of the country. The speed and success of the revolution surprised many throughout the world, as it had not been precipitated by a military defeat, a financial crisis, or a peasant rebellion. Although both nationalists and Marxists joined with Islamic traditionalists to overthrow the Shah, tens of thousands were killed and executed by the Islamic regime afterward, the revolution ultimately resulted in an Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following the IranIraq War President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his administration concentrated on a pragmatic pro-business policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution. Rafsanjani served until 1997 when he was succeeded by the moderate reformist Mohammad Khatami. During his two terms as president, Khatami advocated freedom of expression, tolerance and civil society, constructive diplomatic relations with other states including EU and Asian governments, and an economic policy that supported free market and foreign investment. However, Khatami is widely regarded as having been unsuccessful in achieving his goal of making Iran more free and democratic. In the 2005 presidential elections, Iran made yet another change in political direction, when conservative populist candidate Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected over Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_IRAQ_PEDIA">[TAB]Iraq was home to the earliest known civilization on Earth, the Sumerian civilization, which arose in the fertile Tigris-Euphrates river valley of southern Iraq in the mid 6th millennium BC. It was here in the late 4th millennium BC, that the world's first writing system and recorded history itself were born. The Sumerian civilization flourished for over 3000 years and was succeeded by the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 24th century BC. Over two centuries of Akkadian dominance was followed by a Sumerian Renaissance in the 21st century BC. An Elamite invasion in 2004 BC brought the Third Dynasty of Ur to an end. By the 18th century BC a new civilization, Babylonia, had risen to dominance in central and southern Iraq while a contemporaneous civilization, Assyria, had formed in northern Iraq.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Islamic conquest in the 7th century CE established Islam in Iraq. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, the prophet Mohammed's cousin and son-in-law Ali moved his capital to Kufa \"fi al-Iraq\" when he became the fourth caliph. The Umayyad Caliphate ruled the province of Iraq from Damascus in the 7th century. (However, eventually there was a separate, independent Caliphate of Cordoba.) The Abbasid Caliphate built the city of Baghdad in the 8th century as their capital, and it became the leading metropolis of the Arab and Muslim world for five centuries. Baghdad was the largest multicultural city of the Middle Ages, peaking at a population of more than a million, and was the centre of learning during the Islamic Golden Age. The Mongols destroyed the city during the sack of Baghdad in the 13th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the end of World War I, the League of Nations granted the area to the United Kingdom as a mandate. It initially formed two former Ottoman vilayets (regions): Baghdad and Basra into a single country in August 1921. Five years later, in 1926, the northern vilayet of Mosul was added, forming the territorial boundaries of the modern Iraqi state. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of King Faisal, though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. King Ghazi of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see Anglo-Iraqi War), for fear that the government of Rashid Ali al-Gaylani might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the Axis powers. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947.[PARAGRAPH:2]The reinstated Hashemite monarchy lasted until 1958, when it was overthrown by a coup d'etat of the Iraqi Army, known as the 14 July Revolution. The coup brought Brigadier General Abdul Karim Qassim to power. He withdrew from the Baghdad Pact and established friendly relations with the Soviet Union, but his government lasted only until the February 1963 coup, when it was overthrown by Colonel Abdul Salam Arif. Salam Arif died in 1966 and his brother, Abdul Rahman Arif, assumed the presidency. In 1968, Rahman Arif was overthrown by the Arab Socialist Baath Party. Ahmed Hasan Al-Bakir became the first Baath President of Iraq but then the movement gradually came under the control of Saddam Hussein al Tikriti, who acceded to the presidency and control of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), then Iraq's supreme executive body, in July 1979.[PARAGRAPH:2]Beginning with the invasion in 2003, a multinational coalition of forces, mainly American and British, occupied Iraq. Under the Laws of War and UNSCR 1483, the occupying Coalition Provisional Authority completed the transfer of sovereignty on June 28, 2004 to the Iraqi Interim Government in accordance with UNSCR 1546, formally ending the \"occupation.\" Elections on January 30, 2005 created the Iraqi Transitional Government, which drafted the Constitution of Iraq, approved by referendum on October 25, 2005. Under this new Constitution, elections chose a new Iraqi National Assembly to form the Government of Iraq. Some dispute whether Iraq is de facto sovereign.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_IRELAND_PEDIA">[TAB]Most people call the arrival of the Celts the beginning of Irish history.  However, earlier peoples inhabited the land known as Ireland.  Beautiful gold jewelry and pottery have been preserved to reveal their artistic skills.  Their religious beliefs and practices are indicated in the decoration of their burial sites.  The Celts came from Gaul, modern day France, around the 4th century BC.  They dominate the people inhabiting the land with their iron swords.  They developed an exact code of laws and honored their poets as much as kings.  In the 5th century, St. Patrick came to Ireland and converted the people to Christianity.  As a result, many monasteries were built and Irish monks brought Christianity into Europe.  Because of Ireland's religious importance, it was also known as the Island of Saints and Scholars.  However, a series of insignificant kings made strong governments impossible, leaving Ireland susceptible to various invaders. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The first invaders of Ireland were the Viking sailors from northern Europe.  They founded many of the coastal cities of Ireland, which have been known throughout history as the most important.  Dublin, Cork, and Limerick all owe their establishment to the Vikings, who first struck around the early 9th century.  They remained in control of Ireland for several centuries.  However, they had little power in the famous Battle of Clontarf, near Dublin.  In this battle, the Irish king Brian Boru won a decisive victory in 1014. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The Kings of England had long been aware of the island to the west.  In 1169, the Norman barons came to Ireland, lead by King Henry II of England, and forced the Gaelic kings to submit.  They were used to the loose power of the Irish High King and were eager to shift their loyalty to England.  England tightened its grip over the years, causing many Irish people to lose their cultural identity and adapt to England.  The English colonists in Ireland spoke English and Norman French rather than Gaelic.  In time, they began to intermarry with the Irish and accept their traditions. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Laws were passed to keep the English and Irish apart in 1366.  It became illegal for the English to intermarry with the Irish.  After the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, the feelings of antagonism turned into a spiritual war.  Henry VIII wanted the Catholics of Ireland to follow the Church of England.  His daughter Queen Elizabeth I took land in Ireland and gave it to English settlers.  A part of it was given to Sir Walter Raleigh who, according to legend, planted the first potato in Ireland.  The Irish resisted the English stalwartly on several instances.  The great Hugh O'Neill rallied the Irish forces and won victories during a nine year war.  The Battle of Kinsale in 1601 was one of the decisive battles in Ireland's history, but ended in defeat of the Irish.  Oliver Cromwell, the Puritan leader of England, finally crushed the Irish resistance during mid-17th century.  He filled the entire country with British settlers and forced Catholic tenants to move to less fertile lands.  Irish Catholics were allowed to keep only a third of all the land in Ireland. [PARAGRAPH: 2] However, a new hope befell the Irish after a Catholic king, James II, came to power in England.  However, the Protestant English nobles offered the throne to the Protestant William III.  As a result of the Catholic's opposition to William, the English Parliament passed the Penal Laws.  These laws stated that the Irish Catholics had no legal or religious rights and were reduced into poverty.  The French and American revolutions seemed to indicate a new era of liberty.  Two attempted rebellions, one in 1798 and the other in 1803, both failed.  However, an Act of Union stated Ireland would be part of the United Kingdom and Irish Catholics were promised seats in the British Parliament.  The latter, however, was denied by King George III.  Not until 1829 was this law repealed that denied the Catholics representation in Parliament. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The famine of 1845-49 brought new troubles to Ireland.  It reduced the population by 2,500,000.  About 1,500,000 died of disease and hunger, while the other portion moved to the United States and other countries.  Home Rule became a popular demand, which was carried out by Charles Stewart Parnell.  However, he lost his following when he was involved in a divorce case.  During World War I, many Irish people joined the British army, while other joined the Irish volunteers, a group formed to defend the rights of the Irish people.  In 1916, volunteers joined the Citizen Army, formed for the defense of the workers after the great Dublin strike in1913.  The group attempted to capture Dublin and proclaim an Irish republic.  However, they were forced to surrender to the British after several of the group's important leaders were shot. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Despite these setbacks, the Irish people still had their minds set on independence.  After a war in 1921, Britain and Ireland signed a treaty by which twenty-six counties became a free state in the British Commonwealth.  Six of the counties of Ulster remained apart as Northern Ireland, a province of the United Kingdom.  Wars broke out between the supporters and opponents of the treaty.  The opposition was lead by Eamon de Valera, who was elected president of the Republic in 1918.  A new constitution was drawn up in 1936, and the country was to be ruled by a president and a prime minister.  In 1948, Ireland was set up and left the Commonwealth. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Irish nationalists have always been opposed the partition of the country.  In fact, the Irish constitution grants citizenship in the republic to the people of Northern Ireland.  The Catholics of Northern Ireland feel they are discriminated against.  Still, the Protestants in Ireland, the majority, are afraid they will be absorbed by the Catholics to the south.  The problems created by the partition have lead to years of aggression and strife.  In order to settle the dispute, the Irish government signed a treaty with the United Kingdom that stated that the Irish government had an advisory role in setting up the policy of Northern Ireland.  In 1995, the Irish and British set up a structure for consultations in Northern Ireland, with the provision that the province's future would be determined by the people.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ISRAEL_PEDIA">[TAB]Israel is a small nation in the Middle East, located in Southwest Asia on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.  The State of Israel was established in 1948 as a refuge for Jews worldwide.  The founders of the modern state of Israel sought to create a new country whose principles, customs, and way of life would be Jewish. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Jewish kingdoms flourished in the region in ancient times, but before 1948, there had been no Jewish state for 2,000 years.  The Jews were scattered all over the world after the Romans had driven them out in the first and second centuries AD.  Despite all this oppression, the Jews never forgot the Land of Israel.  The Jews are closely connected with the Land of Israel because of all of the religious events that occurred in Israel.  There were also very important events in history in Israel, such as the destruction of the temple and the rise and fall of Jewish kingdoms.  When Jews were persecuted in the Middle Ages, it was the hope of returning to Israel that kept them alive. [PARAGRAPH: 2]  The Exodus out of Egypt, lead by Moses, lead the Hebrews to the ancient Land of Israel. The Philistines forced the Hebrews to unite under a single leader, Saul, who lead the Hebrews to victory over the Philistines.  Saul is usually regarded as the first Hebrew king.  Saul was followed by King David.  David was a hero from childhood, when he had slain eyed the lion-beast Goliath.  David declared Jerusalem the capital, and created a powerful military.  David also brought the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, which contained two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written.  Solomon followed David.  Solomon was a master diplomat, who builds roads, fortresses, and a royal palace.  Most famous is SolomonÂs temple, known as the Temple of Solomon.  The Temple of Solomon was the center of Jewish religion in that time [PARAGRAPH: 2]  High taxes in Israel lead to the division of the kingdom.  The north, Israel, carried most of the population and territory.  The small and southern portion became Judah.  Israel survived for two centuries.  It was destroyed internally, and was caught by rival empires.  At 734 BC, the Assyrians invaded Israel.  They killed many Israelites and exiled many more.  Judah, had less violence than Israel.  In 586 BC, Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians and the Temple of Solomon was destroyed.  But the Judeans refused to forget there homeland of Judah.  The Judeans came together in gatherings that were the forerunner for synogogues.  The listened to there prophets.  When Cyrus the Great of Persia took control of Palestinian lands, he allowed the Judeans to return to there land.  For 600 years, there was another Jewish state. [PARAGRAPH: 2]   When the Judeans returned to Israel, the process of creating a new kingdom proved to be hard.  There was religious troubles in Israel.  Non-Jews were scorned in Judean society.  New prophets had to teach that God was not only meant for the Jews, but all people.  In the fourth century BC, Alexander the Great defeated the country.  This brought in pagan customs to the land.  Some youths even abandoned Jewish traditions.  A later Greek ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, persecuted the Jews and their traditions.  Under Judah Maccabee and his brothers, a revolt flared.  In 165, the Jewish state was independent once again.[PARAGRAPH: 2]  In the first century BC, Rome conquered the Jewish State.  RomeÂs rule was tyrannical, and a Jewish revolt began in 66 AD.  The Roman legions conquered Jerusalem after a long resistance in 70 AD.  The Romans destroyed the temple, and all that remained was the wall.  This wall became known as the Wailing Wall, and is the holiest place for prayer for the Jews today.  In 73 AD, the Romans conquered Masada, and the Jewish state was destroyed.  The Jewish people were in exile.  For many years, the Jews faced horrible punishment for being Jews during the Middle Ages. [PARAGRAPH: 2]  In the 19th Century, waves of anti-Semitism spread across Eastern Europe, where many Jew lived.  Many Jews emigrated to the United States and Europe.  Some moved to Palestine, the location of the ancient Land of Israel.  This idea of creating a new Jewish state is called Zionism.  The Holocaust of World War II, when six million Jews were murdered, added to the intensity of the Zionist movement.  The war also left many Jewish refugees in Europe.  Many preferred to establish a new nation rather than move to new homes, or go back to their old country. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The United Nations noticed the need for a Jewish homeland, and in 1947, it recommended that Palestine be turned into a Jewish state.  On May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion, IsraelÂs first prime minister, declared IsraelÂs independence.  Many Arab countries opposed this decision, and this sparked the years of Arab-Israeli conflict that would come.  Israel since has developed into a modern democracy, and is one of the most powerful countries in the Middle East.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ITALY_PEDIA">[TAB]Ancient Rome was a civilization that grew from a small agricultural community founded on the Italian Peninsula circa the 8th century BC to a colossal empire straddling the Mediterranean Sea. In its twelve-century existence, Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy, to a republic based on a combination of oligarchy and democracy, to an autocratic empire. It came to dominate Western Europe and the entire area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea through conquest and assimilation.[PARAGRAPH:2]Italia, under the Roman Republic and later Empire, was the name of the Italian Peninsula. During the Republic, Italia (which extended at the time from Rubicon to Calabria) was not a province, but rather the territory of the city of Rome, thus having a special status: for example, military commanders were not allowed to bring their armies within Italia, and Julius Caesar passing the Rubicon with his legions marked the start of the civil war. From the 3rd century, the Roman Empire went into decline. The western half of the empire, including Hispania, Gaul, and Italy, broke into independent kingdoms in the 5th century. The eastern empire, governed from Constantinople, is usually referred to as the Byzantine Empire after 476, the traditional date for the \"fall of Rome\" and for the subsequent onset of the Early Middle Ages, also known as the Dark Ages.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Italian history the rise of the Signorie is a phase often associated with the decline of the medieval commune system of government and the rise of the dynastic state. The composition and specific functions of the Signoria varied from city to city. In some states (such as Verona under the Della Scala family or Florence in the days of Cosimo de Medici and Lorenzo the Magnificent) the polity was what we would term today a single party state in which the dominant party had vested the Signoria of the state in a single family or dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:2]Italy at this time was notable for its merchant Republics, including the Republic of Florence and the Maritime Republics. They were city-states and they were generally republics in that they were formally independent, though most of them originated from territories once belonging to the Byzantine Empire (the main exceptions being Genoa and Pisa). All these cities during the time of their independence had similar (though not identical) systems of government in which the merchant class had considerable power. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. The four classic Maritime Republics in Italy are Venice, Genoa, Pisa, Amalfi and they are always given in that order, reflecting the temporal sequence of their dominance. However, other towns in Italy also have a history of being Maritime Republics, though historically less prominent. These include Gaeta, Ancona, Molfetta, Trani and, in Dalmatia (under Italian cultural influence), Ragusa and Zara.[PARAGRAPH:2]The unique political structures of late Middle Ages Italy have led some to theorise that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy was divided into smaller city states and territories: the kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States the centre, the Genoese and the Milanese the north and west, and the Venetians the east. Fifteenth-century Italy was one of the most urbanised areas in Europe. Most historians agree that the ideas that characterised the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th century Florence, in particular with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265-1321), Francesco Petrarch (1304-1374) and Giovanni Boccaccio (c. 1313-1375), as well as the painting of Giotto di Bondone (1267-1337).[PARAGRAPH:2]The Renaissance was so called because it was a \"rebirth\" of certain classical ideas that had long been lost to Europe. It has been argued that the fuel for this rebirth was the rediscovery of ancient texts that had been forgotten by Western civilisation, but were preserved in some monastic libraries and in the Islamic world, and the translations of Greek and Arabic texts into Latin. Renaissance scholars such as Niccolò de' Niccoli and Poggio Bracciolini scoured the libraries in search of works by such classical authors as Plato, Cicero and Vitruvius. The works of ancient Greek and Hellenistic writers (such as Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, and Ptolemy) and Muslim scientists were imported into the Christian world, providing new intellectual material for European scholars.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1946 Vittorio Emanuele III's son, Umberto II, was forced to abdicate. Italy became a Republic after the result of a popular referendum held on June 2, 1946, a day celebrated since as Republic Day. This was the first election in Italy allowing women to vote. The Republican Constitution was approved and came into force on January 1, 1948.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_KANEMBORNU_PEDIA">[TAB]The Kanem-Bornu Empire existed in modern Chad and Nigeria. It was known to the Arab geographers as the Kanem Empire from the 9th century AD onward and lasted, in some form, until 1893. At its height it encompassed an area covering not only much of Chad, but also parts of modern southern Libya, eastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon. The Kanem Empire originated at an unknown period to the northeast of Lake Chad. It was located at the southern end of the trans-Saharan trade route between Tripoli and the region of Lake Chad. Besides its urban elite it included a confederation of nomadic peoples.[PARAGRAPH:2]The major factor that influenced the history of the state of Kanem was the early penetration of Islam. North African traders, Berbers and Arabs, brought the new religion. Towards 1068, Hummay, a member of the Sayfawa establishment, who was already a Muslim, discarded the last Duguwa king Selma from power and thus established the new dynasty of the Sayfuwa. Islam offered the Sayfawa rulers the advantage of new ideas from Arabia and the Mediterranean world, as well as literacy in administration. But many people resisted the new religion favouring traditional beliefs and practices. When Hummay had assumed power on the basis of his strong Islamic following, for example, it is believed that the Duguwa/Zaghawa began some kind of internal opposition. This pattern of conflict and compromise with Islam occurs repeatedly in Chadian history.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kanem-Bornu peaked during the reign of the outstanding statesman Mai Idris Aluma (c. 1571-1603). Aluma is remembered for his military skills, administrative reforms, and Islamic piety. His main adversaries were the Hausa to the west, the Tuareg and Toubou to the north, and the Bulala to the east. One epic poem extols his victories in 330 wars and more than 1,000 battles. His innovations included the employment of fixed military camps (with walls); permanent sieges and \"scorched earth\" tactics, where soldiers burned everything in their path; armored horses and riders; and the use of Berber camelry, Kotoko boatmen, and iron-helmeted musketeers trained by Turkish military advisers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Aluma introduced a number of legal and administrative reforms based on his religious beliefs and Islamic law (sharia). He sponsored the construction of numerous mosques and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he arranged for the establishment of a hostel to be used by pilgrims from his empire. As with other dynamic politicians, Aluma's reformist goals led him to seek loyal and competent advisers and allies, and he frequently relied on slaves who had been educated in noble homes. Aluma regularly sought advice from a council composed of heads of the most important clans. He required major political figures to live at the court, and he reinforced political alliances through appropriate marriages (Aluma himself was the son of a Kanuri father and a Bulala mother).[PARAGRAPH:2]Although the dynasty ended, the kingdom of Kanem-Bornu survived. But Umar, who eschewed the title mai for the simpler designation shehu (from the Arabic shaykh), could not match his father's vitality and gradually allowed the kingdom to be ruled by advisers (wazirs). Bornu began to decline, as a result of administrative disorganization, regional particularism, and attacks by the militant Ouaddai Empire to the east. The decline continued under Umar's sons, and in 1893 Rabih az-Zubayr, leading an invading army from eastern Sudan, conquered Bornu.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_KAZAKH_PEDIA">[TAB]Kazakhstan has been inhabited since the Stone Age: the region's climate and terrain are best suited for nomads practicing pastoralism. Historians believe that humans first domesticated the horse in the region's vast steppes. While ancient cities Taraz (Aulie-Ata) and Hazrat-e Turkestan had long served as important way-stations along the Silk Road connecting East and West, real political consolidation only began with the Mongol invasion of the early 13th century. Under the Mongol Empire, administrative districts were established, and these eventually came under the emergent Kazakh Khanate.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the 17th century Kazakhs fought Oirats, a federation of western Mongol tribes, among which the Dzungars were particularly aggressive. The beginning of the 18th century marked the zenith of the Kazakh Khanate. During this period the Little Horde participated in the 1723-1730 war against the Dzungars, following their \"Great Disaster\" invasion of Kazakh territories. Under leadership Abul Khair Khan the Kazakhs won major victories over the Dzungar at the Bulanty River, in 1726, and at the Battle of Anrakay in 1729.Ablai Khan participated in the most significant battles against the Dzungars from the 1720s to the 1750s, for which he was declared a \"batyr\" (\"hero\") by the people. Kazakhs were also a victims of constant raids carried out by the Volga Kalmyks.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Russian Empire introduced a system of administration and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the so-called \"Great Game\" between it and the British Empire. The first Russian outpost, Orsk, was built in 1735. Russia enforced the Russian language in all schools and governmental organisations. Russian efforts to impose its system aroused the extreme resentment by the Kazakh people, and by the 1860s, most Kazakhs resisted Russia's annexation largely because of the disruption it wrought upon the traditional nomadic lifestyle and livestock-based economy, and the associated hunger which was rapidly wiping out some Kazakh tribes. The Kazakh national movement, which began in the late 1800s, sought to preserve the native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the Russian Empire to assimilate and stifle them.[PARAGRAPH:2]Soviet repression of the traditional elite, along with forced collectivization in late 1920s-1930s, brought mass hunger and led to unrest. Between 1926 and 1939, the Kazakh population declined by 22%, due to starvation, violence and mass emigration. Today, the estimates suggest that the population of Kazakhstan would be closer to 20 million if there had been no starvation or massacre of Kazakhs. During the 1930s, many renowned Kazakh writers, thinkers, poets, politicians and historians were slaughtered on Stalin's orders, both as part of the repression and as a methodical pattern of suppressing Kazakh identity and culture. The Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) contributed five national divisions to the Soviet Union's World War II effort.[PARAGRAPH:2]Caught up in the groundswell of Soviet republics seeking greater autonomy, Kazakhstan declared its sovereignty as a republic within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in October 1990. Following the August 1991 aborted coup attempt in Moscow and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan declared independence on December 16, 1991. It was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence.[PARAGRAPH:2]The years following independence have been marked by significant reforms to the Soviet-style economy and political monopoly on power. Under Nursultan Nazarbayev, who initially came to power in 1989 as the head of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and was eventually elected President in 1991, Kazakhstan has made significant progress toward developing a market economy. The country has enjoyed significant economic growth since 2000, partly due to its large oil, gas, and mineral reserves. Democracy, however, has not gained much ground since 1991.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_KHAZARIA_PEDIA">[TAB]In the seventh century, in the region between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, a free Jewish state was established.  Its people were a mix of Khazar Turks, whom were part of the Gok Turkic Migration, the Huns, the Bulgars, and the Caucasians.  The story of the Khazar Empire begins when the infant-empire Khagan Bulan heard from an Arab mullah, a Christian priest, and a Jewish rabbi on the reasons why Khazaria should adopt each of their religions.  After much thought, Bulan decided to adopt the Jewish faith.  Nowhere else in the world, has a non-Jewish nation undergone such a conversion as Bulan faced the Muslim expansion of the South, and the Christian expansion to the west.  A few wars between the Khazars and Arabs prevented Islam from spreading across all of eastern Europe at a time when Islam was attracting many followers.  It also became a place of safety and refuge for the Jewish people, as the rest of the world were persecuted.[PARAGRAPH: 1]Khazar power begins at about 650 BC, when the Turkic kingdom formed after the breakup of the Gok Turks and the collapse of their rival the Avars.  Khazar culture was molded around the Gok Turks, with the Khagan holding supreme power and the Khagan Bek being the military power.  The Khazars used a runic script that originated in Mongolia as their language.  Most of the Turkish groups of the period used the same type of language.[PARAGRAPH: 1]Arab scholars of the time provide the most knowledge of the Khazars.  An 11th century Muslim chronicler elaborated on the man who brought the Jewish faith to Khazaria.  His writings explain how a single Khazar Jew, who had a high military rank, converted all the other Khazars to Judaism.  The chronicler went on to explain how the Khazars observed Judaism.  Obadiah, one of Bulan's descendants, consolidated the newly-adopted religion with the construction of synogogues and invited Jewish scholars to confine other doubters among the aristocracy.  However, it was not only the military elite and the nobles who were converted.  The common people embraced the new religion with open arms.  Pagan shamanism was the Khazar's original religion, remained in place as were other religions.  Incredibly, a seven-strong Supreme Court with representatives of all faiths was established to ensure fair hearing for all people.  Such religious tolerance was unheard of.[PARAGRAPH: 1]Although the Khazars were nomadic people, the conversion to Judaism rapidly opted for a more settled existence with Khazaria prospering from farming, the production of goods, and trading.  Khazaria also did play a role in the defeat of Persia in the 7th century, allying it self with the Turks and the Byzantines.  There were also a series of wars in the 8th century against the Arabs that established Khazaria's southern borders at the Caucasus Mountains.  However, the Khazars are associated with a period of peace along the steppe because they were more concerned with commerce than warfare.[PARAGRAPH: 1]The Khazars were very cooperative with their neighbors such that the Byzantines build a wall for them at the city of Sarkel along the Don River.  Byzantine emperors Justinian II and Constantine V both took a Khazar wife.  Khazar also brought many new technologies in since Jews from all over the world came in search of a Jewish beacon.  All this helped to strengthen Khazaria and make it into a cosmopolitan and a progressive civilization.[PARAGRAPH: 1]At the empires greatest extent at 850, it stretched from the Black to the Caspian sea.  The waterways were trading links and the Khazars built the city of Kiev, later becoming its capital.  The most enduring of Khazar capitals was Itil.  It had a trading post, an administrative center, and religious hearland for the Jews.  It also had an Islamic mosque to serve the Muslim population.  Khazar power ended under Svyatoslav, the ruler of Kiev.  Khazaria was then taken over by the neighboring Pechenegs, Oghuz, and Byzantine peoples.  Khazar traders faced difficult circumstances during these times and all mention of them ends.  The Penchenegs who had much of Khazar land did not focus on trade, and disrupted the trade with Eastern Europe.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_LATVIA_PEDIA">Latvia; Latvian: Latvija, officially the Republic of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Republika) is a country in Northern Europe in the Baltic region. It is bordered to the north by Estonia (343 km), to the south by Lithuania (588 km), and to the east both by Belarus (141 km) and the Russian Federation (276 km).  Across the Baltic Sea to the west lies Sweden. The territory of Latvia covers 64,589 kmï¿½ and is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate.The Latvians are a Baltic people closely related to the Lithuanians, with the Latvian language sharing many similarities to Lithuanian. Today the Latvians and Lithuanians are the only surviving members of the Baltic peoples and Baltic languages of the Indo-European family. The modern name of Latvia is thought to originate from the ancient Latvian name Latvji, which may have originated from the river named Latva or Latuva, which may be today's Lates upe.Latvia is a democratic parliamentary republic and is divided into 26 districts. The capital and largest city is Riga. Latvia has been a member of the United Nations since 17 September 1991, of the European Union since 1 May 2004 and of NATO since 29 March 2004.The Vikings invaded the area now known as Latvia in the 9th century, which was ruled by pagan Baltic tribes and stood on a trading crossroads between Scandinavia and Russia. The Russians attacked in the 10th century. The invasion of the Teutonic Knights (German crusaders) in the 13th century was resisted in a lengthy struggle, but Latvia eventually came under their control in 1230, converted to Christianity, and was governed by them for more than 200 years. By 1562 Poland and Lithuania had taken over most of the country. Sweden conquered the north in 1621 and Russia took over control of this area in 1710. By 1800 all of Latvia had come under Russian control. Serfdom was abolished between 1817-19 and the country became increasingly urbanized. A Latvian nationalist movement began to emerge in the mid 19th century and grew from the 1890s.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_LITHUANIA_PEDIA">[TAB] The Lithuanian tribes were first united under Duke Mindaugas in about 1230.  In 1251, Mindaugas was converted to Christianity and crowned king.  However, his nobles revolted and killed him, and Lithuania was returned to the pagan worship of nature.  In 1387, the Grand Duke Jogaila accepted the Polish crown and created a personal alliance with Poland.  He converted to Christianity, and with the help of his cousin, Grand Duke Vytautas, converted the Lithuanians to Christianity.  Lithuania expanded greatly under the reign of Vytautas, earning him the title \"the Great.\" [PARAGRAPH: 1] In 1795, in the concluding division of Poland, Lithuania was taken over by the Russian Empire.  A Lithuanian nationalist movement began in the 1800s.  After the Russian Empire was removed from power, Lithuania proclaimed its independence on February 16, 1918.  When World War II broke out in 1939, Lithuania declared itself neutral.  In 1940, however, as a result of a secret pact between Nazi German and Soviet leaders, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union.  Aside from the interval of German occupation from 1941 to 1944, Lithuania was to remain a Soviet republic until 1991.  Lithuanian armed resistance to the Soviets caused tens of thousands of casualties.  The Soviets deported an estimated 300,000 people, held back freedoms, and made the country economically dependent on the Soviet Union. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In the middle of the 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union and began a series of liberal reforms.  In 1988, Lithuanians organized their own reform movement, called Sajudis.  It gained a large amount of support in the country and was able to dictate the Lithuanian Communist party, which broke with the Soviet Communists in 1989.  In multiparty elections for a new parliament in 1990, Sajudis was victorious.  Lithuanian independence was restored, and Vytautas Landbergis was elected president.  Gorbachev responded with an economic blockade and a show of military force, both of which failed.  In 1991, Gorbachev recognized the independence of Lithuania, just a few months before the collapse of the Soviet Union itself.  In the 1992 elections, the Democratic Labor Party won one third of the seats in parliament.  Presidential elections in 1993 resulted in a victory for the leader of the party, Algirdas Brazauskas, over Landsbergis.  In 1995, Sajudis regained a majority of the seats in parliament.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_LOMBARD_PEDIA">[TAB]The history of the Langobards begins with a small tribe known as the Winniler.  The Winniler dwelled on a Nordic Island called Scanan.  The Winniler were split into three groups, and the third moved out of the original land.  The departing people were lead by brother Ybor and Aio and their mother Gambara.  They arrived on the lands of Scoringa, which was ruled by Wandals.  At the moment, the people of Scoringa were forced to either pay tribute, or go to war.  The Winniler chose to go to war, and because they had such few numbers, women were forced to fight alongside men.  The women tied their hair in front of their faces.  When they were spotted, many noticed their long beards.  From this moment on, the Winniler were known as the Langobard, which is Latinized to Langobards. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The Langobard dwelt near the river Elbe next to the Chauci.  Archaeological finds show that early Langobard society revolved around agriculture.  The first mention of the Langobards occurred between 9 and 16 AD.  They were mentioned by the Roman court historian Velleius Paterculus.  Paterculus described them as being \"fiercer than normal German savagery.\"  The Langobards were assumed as a Seubian tribe, subjects of King Marobod of the Marcomanni.  The Marcomanni at the time made peace with the Romans, and that is why the Langobards were not part of the German confederacy. [PARAGRAPH: 2] In the second century, the Langobards appear in Rhineland.  The Langobard had greatly expanded during this time.  Just before the year 166, the Langobards and Obii crossed the Danube and invaded Pannonia.  The Langobards lost the war, and returned back to their homes on the river Elbe.  After this time, the Langobards seem to disappear from history.  One reason is that the Langobards could have delved deeper into the Germanic lands.  While some Langobard migrated, others were absorbed by the surrounding Saxons.  Shortly after, the Langobards rose up against the Saxons with their king Agelmund.  The Langobards began on another migration. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The crossing into Mauringa was difficult because the Usipetes denied the Langobards passage.  Because of this, a fight was arranged between the strongest men of each tribe.  The Langobards left the fight as victors, and their passage was granted.  The Langobards reached Mauringa, and the first king, Agelmund, ruled for thirty years.  The Langobards then departed from Mauringa and arrived at Golanda.  The Golanda was a land on the bank of the Oder.  Leaving Golanda, the Langobards passed through Anthaib and Banthaib until they at last reached Vurgundaib.  The Huns attacked the Langobards, and killed their King Agelmund.  The Langobards rose up against the Huns under the new king Laimicho.  [PARAGRAPH: 2] In the year 560, a new king emerged who would mark a turning point in Langobard history, Alboin.  Alboin defeated the Gepids, made them his subjects and led the Langobards and a federation of other tribes across the Julian Alps to invade Italy.  The first important city to fall was Forum Iulii, in which he created the first Langobard duchy.  His nephew, Gisulph, was to be the duke.  In the summer of 569, the Langobards conquered Milan, which at the time was in terrible condition because of the Gothic Wars.  Pavia fell under siege after three years, becoming the first capital of the new Langobard kingdom.  In the upcoming years, the Langobards established two duchies further south, Spoleto and Benevento.  The Byzantines managed to retain control of Ravenna and Rome. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The Langobard territory was divided into 36 duchies.  The king ruled over them and administered the land through representatives called gastaldi.  This unity was however weak, and the Langobards lost control over Spoleto and Benevento to the Franks over time.  The deaths of Alboin and his son Cleph resulted in a ten year interregnum known as the \"Rule of the Dukes\".  The dukes, threatened by the Franks, elected the son of Cleph, Authari, their next king.  Authari tried to reorganize the royal administration, and manage to end the dangerous alliance between the Byzantines and the Franks.  After Authari's death in 590, Agilulf, duke of Turin, ruled.  He successfully fought the rebels from Northern Italy and conquered Padua and Mantua. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Rothari, the next ruler, extended the kingdom by conquering Ligura and the remaining part of the Byzantine territories of Veneto.  Rothari also wrote the laws of his people in Latin.  Rothari's son, Rodoald, succeeded him but was killed by the Catholic party.  After the death of Aripert in 661, the kingdom was divided between his children.  The capitals were in Milan and Pavia.  Gromoald overthrew Perctarit, ruler of the Milan-centered Langobardia, and defeated the Franks and conquered southern Italy. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Religious troubles remained the source of struggle in the following years.  The Langobards managed to gain control over Spoleto and Benevento. They also helped the Frankish Marshall Charles Martel drive back the Arabs.  Aistulf conquered Ravenna for the first time, but was defeated by the king of the Franks, Pippin III.  The last Langobard king to rule was Desiderius, duke of Tuscany.  He attempted to prevent the Pope from attacking, and entered Rome for the first time.  Charlemagne continued to defeat the Langobards on countless occasions to follow.  Charlemagne took the title \"King of the Langobards\". [PARAGRAPH: 2] The Langobards of Southern Italy had not yet been conquered by Charlemagne, and made several attempts to produce a king with little success.  The Langobards of Sothern Italy were now claimed by two empires, the Carolingian and Byzantine.  Benevento at this time grew to it greatest extent. Langobard culture became embedded in formerly Greek Apulia.  A civil war spread throughout Langobard lands for ten years after Emperor Louis II, the only Frankish king to exercise power over the Langobard states, imposed a peace treaty.  The kingdom was divided into two states into the Principalities of Benevento of Salerno.  Arabs began conquering Langobard cities and lands.  The papacy began absorbing the remaining Langobard lands, which over time was losing their power.  The remnants of the Langobards can still be seen in the modern Langobardy region of Italy.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_MAGHREB_PEDIA">[TAB]The word 'maghreb' is an Arabic term literally meaning \"place of setting (of the sun)\", and hence \"West.\" It derives from the root ghuroob, meaning \"to set\" or \"to be hidden\". Maghrebis are of mixed origins. They are mainly of Berber and/or Arab origins; the resulting mix is sometimes (particularly in Mauritania) termed Moorish. The Trans-Saharan trade brought in numerous West Africans, whose average contribution to the population increases as one goes south. In the northern coastal towns, conversely, several waves of European immigrants have influenced the population - notably Moriscos, Spanish Muslims who fled the Reconquista, Turks who came over with the Ottoman Empire, and French, Italians, Spanish, and others captured by the corsairs. Jewish communities have historically been present in the older cities, and have contributed to the wider gene pool through conversion. In Algeria especially, a large European minority, the \"pied noirs\", immigrated under French colonial rule; the overwhelming majority of these, however, left immediately following independence.[PARAGRAPH:2]From the end of the Ice Age, when the Sahara Desert dried up, contact between the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa was extremely limited by the difficulty in crossing the desert. This remained the case until after the time of the Arab expansion and the spread of Islam; even then, trans-Saharan trade was restricted to costly (but often profitable) caravan expeditions, trading such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and slaves.[PARAGRAPH:2]Originally, the Maghreb was inhabited by \"Caucasoid\" Cro-Magnoids (Iberomaurusians) in the north and by \"Black\" peoples in the Sahara. Later, about 8000 BC, there came from the east \"Caucasoid\" speakers of northern Afro-Asiatic languages such as Berber at least since the Capsian culture. Many ports along the Maghreb coast were occupied by Phoenicians, particularly Carthaginians; with the defeat of Carthage, many of these ports naturally passed to Rome, and ultimately it took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains, apart from some of the most mountainous regions like the Moroccan Rif.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Arabs reached the Maghreb in early Umayyad times, but their control over it was quite weak, and various Islamic \"heresies\" such as the Ibadis and the Shia, adopted by some Berbers, quickly threw off Caliphal control in the name of their interpretations of Islam. The Arabic language became widespread only later, as a result of the invasion of the Banu Hilal (unleashed, ironically, by the Berber Fatimids in punishment for their Zirid clients' defection) in the 1100's. Throughout this period, the Maghreb fluctuated between occasional unity (as under the Almohads, and briefly under the Hafsids) and more commonly division into three states roughly corresponding to modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and Tunisia.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the Middle Ages, the area east of Morocco was loosely under the control of the Ottoman Empire. After the 19th century, it was colonized by France, Spain and later Italy. Today over two and a half million Maghrebins live in France, especially from Algeria, as well as many more French of Maghrebin origin.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_MAJAPAHIT_PEDIA">[TAB]Majapahit was the last medieval Hindu-Javanese empire to wield much influence in Southeast Asia. When emissaries from Mongol China appeared at Singhasari in 1289, the great warrior-king Kertanagara promptly arrested and expelled them. This provoked a punitive Chinese expedition to eastern Java in 1292; it arrived to find that Kertanagara had been killed in an uprising engineered by a prince of the displaced house of Kadiri. Kertanagara's son Vijaya was forced to flee to a village on the Brantas River named Majapahit (bitter fruit). Vijaya enlisted the support of the newly arrived Chinese forces to drive the Kadiri usurper out of Singhasari and recover the throne. He then compelled his Chinese supporters to withdraw and depart homeward.[PARAGRAPH:1]The village of Majapahit became Vijaya's new capital. Gajah Mada was appointed prime minister in 1331, and under his direction Majapahit filled the political vacuum left by the fall of the Srivijaya empire and the dissolution of its temporary successor, Singhasari. As early as 1365, Majapahit could claim domination over most of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Its hold on the latter extended as far north as Kedah, Langkasuka, and Pantai. Majapahit's influence extended to much of what now comprises Indonesia, extending to territories on the south and west coasts of Borneo, and to southern Celebes and the Moluccas. Some even claim that Majapahit power was felt as far away as the Indo-Chinese peninsula, in Siam, Cambodia, and Annam, though this is doubtful. The infiltration of Islam from the Straits of Malacca into the Southeast Asian archipelago gradually undermined the influence of Majapahit. In 1478 the Muslim coastal state of Demak invaded Majapahit itself, and by the late fifteenth century Majapahit was reduced to little more than an eastern Javanese state with a glorious past.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_MALAGASY_PEDIA">[TAB]The written history of Madagascar began in the 7th century, when Arabs established trading posts along the northwest coast. European contact began in the 1500s, when Portuguese sea captain Diego Dias sighted the island after his ship became separated from a fleet going to India. In the late 17th century, the French established trading posts along the east coast. From about 1774 to 1824, it was a favorite haunt for pirates, including Americans, one of whom brought Malagasy rice to South Carolina.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the middle ages, the chiefs of the different settlements on the island began to extend their power through trade with Madagascar's Indian Ocean neighbors, notably North Africa, the Middle-east and India. Large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Sakalava chiefdoms of the Menabe, centered in what is now the town of Morondava, and of Boina, centered in what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga (Majunga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what is now the provinces of Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara. But with the domination of the Indian Ocean by the British fleet and the end of the Arab slave trade, the Sakalava would lose their power to the emerging Merina threat. For a short time the Betsimisaraka of the east coast also unified, but this unification was short lived.[PARAGRAPH:2]Beginning in the 1790s, Merina rulers succeeded in establishing hegemony over the major part of the island, including the coast. In 1817, the Merina ruler and the British governor of Mauritius concluded a treaty abolishing the slave trade, which had been important in Madagascar's economy. In return, the island received British military and financial assistance. British influence remained strong for several decades, during which the Merina court was converted to Presbyterianism, Congregationalism, and Anglicanism.[PARAGRAPH:2]The British accepted the imposition of a French protectorate over Madagascar in 1885 in return for eventual control over Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania) and as part of an overall definition of spheres of influence in the area. Absolute French control over Madagascar was established by military force in 1895-1896, and the Merina monarchy was abolished. In December 1904, the Russian Baltic Fleet stopped at Diego Suarez for coal and provisions before sailing on to its doomed encounter with the Japanese Fleet in the Battle of Tsushima. Before leaving port the Russian sailors were required to put ashore the animals they had acquired, including monkeys, boa constrictors and one crocodile.[PARAGRAPH:2]During World War II, Malagasy troops fought in France, Morocco, and Syria. Immediately preceding the fall of France, Germany initiated planning to forcibly deport all of Europe's Jews to Madagascar in what was known as the Madagascar Plan. Action on the plan was never begun. After France fell to Germany, the Vichy government administered Madagascar. British troops occupied the strategic island in 1942 to preclude its seizure by the Japanese. The Free French received the island from the United Kingdom in 1943.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1947, with French prestige at low ebb, a nationalist uprising was suppressed after several months of bitter fighting. The French subsequently established reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully toward independence. The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on October 14, 1958, as an autonomous state within the French Community. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on June 26, 1960.[PARAGRAPH:2]Madagascar's population is predominantly of mixed Asian and African origin, though those who are visibly Asian in appearance and culture are the minority, found in the highland regions. Recent research suggests that the island was uninhabited until Malay seafarers arrived between about 2,000 to 1,500 years ago. Recent DNA research shows that the Malagasy are approximately of half Malay and half East African stock, although some Arab, Indian and European influence is present along the coast. The Malagasy language shares some 90% of its basic vocabulary with the Maanyan language from the region of the Barito River in southern Borneo.[PARAGRAPH:2]Subsequent migrations from both the Pacific and Africa further consolidated this original mixture, and 36 separate tribal groups emerged. Asian features are most predominant in the central highlands people, the Merina (3 million) and the Betsileo (2 million); the coastal people (called côtiers) are of more clearly African origin.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Malagasy language is of Malayo-Polynesian origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. French is spoken among the educated population of this former French colony. English is becoming more widely spoken and in 2003 the government began a pilot project of introducing the teaching of English into the primary grades of 44 schools, with hopes of taking the project nationwide.[PARAGRAPH:2]Approximately half of the country's population practices traditional religions, which tend to emphasize links between the living and the dead. The Merina in the highlands particularly tend to hold tightly to this practice. They believe that the dead join their ancestors in the ranks of divinity and that ancestors are intensely concerned with the fate of their living descendants. The Merina and Betsileo reburial practice of famadihana, or \"turning over the dead\" celebrate this spiritual communion. In this ritual, relatives' remains are removed from the family tomb, rewrapped in new silk shrouds, and returned to the tomb following festive ceremonies in their honor.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_MANDE_PEDIA">[TAB]Songhai, was a West African Empire, centered on the largest bend of the Niger River, that reached its zenith in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Songhai, a fishing and trading people who originated in the Dendi region of northwestern Nigeria, gradually extended their domination upstream in the 8th century AD and by 800 had established themselves at Gao, which soon became a flourishing market town. Having come into contact with Muslims from the north, the Songhai accepted Islam, at least nominally, shortly after 1000. For some centuries they dominated the petty adjacent states while being in turn overshadowed by the powerful Mali Empire to the west.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the late 13th century, power in Songhai was consolidated in the Sunni dynasty, which gradually gained independence from Mali and thereafter began to encroach upon the weakening Mali power. Songhai expansion was most aggressively advanced by Sunni Ali, who incorporated the eastern part of Mali into his empire, subjugating Djénné in 1471. He was followed by Muhammad, of the Askia dynasty, who further extended Songhai's influence and made Timbuktu again a thriving cultural center. After his reign, however, dynastic rivalry perilously weakened the empire, while revolts and raids from neighboring states further tested its endurance. An assault by Moroccan forces equipped with firearms in 1591 was the final blow, from which the Songhai state never recovered.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_MAPUCHE_PEDIA">[TAB]The name Mapuche is derived from the \"Mapudungo\" Mapuche language) words for \"Mapu\", which means land, and \"Che\", which means people. In their own language the Mapuche were the people of the land, and also known as Araucanos, a name given to them by the Spanish colonialists the \"huincas\" (Spanish) arrived in 1541, the Mapuche who numbered one and half to two million were the original inhabitants of the Southern Cone of the continent in a region which today covers half of Chile. The Mapuche nation comprised of both sedentary and nomadic communities: hunters and gatherers, shepherds, farmers and fishermen. They lived in small family groups known as lof, which were under the authority of a Lonko (chief). [PARAGRAPH:2]The Mapuche territory had its border with the Inca Empire south of the Maule river. This border was established after a long war and the failure of the Inca to conquer the Mapuche nation by the use of force. The Mapuche territory is divided into four main regions or wallmapus. These are known as: Puelmapu (land of the east), Pikunmapu (land of the north), Lafquenmapu (land of the Pacific coastal region in the west) and Huillimapu (land of the south). Therefore the Mapuche of those regions are identified accordingly, such as Puelche, Pikunche, Lafquenche, Huilliche. There are, however, other areas in which the Mapuche are known by their association with a particular eco-system or natural environment, for example Pewenche (people of the monkey puzzle tree) region, Waidefche (people from the cordillera), Ranquilche (people from the apple tree region), etc. Before the colonialists arrived the Mapuche people had and still have a distintive cultural identity, social organisation, language, religion and way of life. Inhabiting such a vast area the Mapuche had developed regional cultural diversity without a centralized power, but they nevertheless had a strong sense of unity. Their clear sense of nationhood and an unquestionable desire to maintain their self-determination and freedom, forced them into armed resistance, firstly against the Inca Empire and then for over 400 years against the Spanish, Chileans and Argentinians.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_MEGYPT_PEDIA">[H1]Mamluk Empire and Modern Egypt[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Persian invasion early in the 7th century, until in AD 639, Egypt was absorbed into the Islamic Empire by the Muslim Arabs. When they defeated the Byzantine Armies in Egypt, with the help of some revolutionary Egyptians, the Arabs brought Sunni Islam  to the country. Early in this period, Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through Coptic Christianity that was expanded in Egypt by the Byzantines, leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day.  Muslim rulers nominated by the Islamic Caliphate remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries, with Cairo as the seat of the Caliphate under the Fatimids. With the end of the Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty, the Mamluks, a Turco-Circassian military caste, took control about AD 1250. By late 13th century, Egypt linked the Red Sea, India, Malaya, and East Indies.  The strategic positioning \"assured importance in productive economy.\"  They continued to govern the country until the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517, after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire. The mid-14th-Century Black Death killed about 40% of the country's population.  After the 15th century, the threat of military European Crusaders and Central Asian Mongols set the Egyptian system into decline.  The defensive militarization challenged the civil society and economic institutions. The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of Black Death left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion which can be seen with the Portuguese taking over their trade.  Egypt suffered six famines between 1687 and 1731.  The famine that afflicted Egypt in 1784 cost it roughly one-sixth of its population.The brief French invasion of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte  began in 1798. The expulsion of the French in 1801 by Ottoman, Mamluk, and British forces was followed by four years of anarchy in which Ottomans, Mamluks, and Albanians who were nominally in the service of the Ottomans, wrestled for power. Out of this chaos, the commander of the Albanian regiment, Muhammad Ali (Kavalali Mehmed Ali Pasha) emerged as a dominant figure and in 1805 was acknowledged by the Sultan in Istanbul as his viceroy  in Egypt; the title implied subordination to the Sultan but this was in fact a polite fiction: Ottoman power in Egypt was finished and Muhammad Ali, an ambitious and able leader, established a dynasty that was to rule Egypt (at first really and later as British puppets) until the revolution of 1952.  His primary focus was military: he annexed Northern Sudan (18201824), Syria (1833), and parts of Arabia and Anatolia; but in 1841 the European powers, fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself, checked him: he had to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans, but he kept the Sudan and his title to Egypt was made hereditary. A more lasting result of his military ambition is that it made him the moderniser of Egypt. Eager to learn the military (and therefore industrial) techniques of the great powers he sent students to the West and invited training missions to Egypt. He built industries, a system of canals for irrigation and transport, and reformed the civil service.  For better or worse, the introduction in 1820 of long-staple cotton, the Egyptian variety of which became famous, transformed Egyptian agriculture into a cash-crop monoculture before the end of the century. The social effects of this were enormous: it led to the concentration of agriculture in the hands of large landowners, and, with the additional trigger of high cotton prices caused by the United States' civil war production drop, to a large influx of foreigners who began in earnest the exploitation of Egypt for international commodity production.  Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son Ibrahim (in September 1848), then by a grandson Abbas I (in November 1848), then by Said (in 1854), and Isma'il (in 1863). Abbas I was cautious. Said and Ismail were ambitious developers; unfortunately they spent beyond their means. The Suez Canal, built in partnership with the French, was completed in 1869. The cost of this and other projects had two effects: it led to enormous debt to European banks, and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required. In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt's share in the canal to the British Government. Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet, and, \"with the financial power of the bondholders behind them, were the real power in the Government.\"  Local dissatisfaction with Ismail and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879, with Ahmad Urabi a prominent figure. In 1882 he became head of a nationalist-dominated ministry committed to democratic reforms including parliamentary control of the budget. Fearing a diminishment of their control, Britain and France intervened militarily, bombarding Alexandria and crushing the Egyptian army at the battle of Tel el-Kebir.  They reinstalled Ismail's son Tewfik as figurehead of a de facto British protectorate.In 1914 the Protectorate was made official, and the title of the head of state, which had changed from pasha to khedive in 1867, was changed to sultan, to repudiate the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan, who was backing the Central powers in World War I. Abbas II was deposed as khedive and replaced by his uncle, Hussein Kamel, as sultan.  In 1906, the Dinshaway Incident prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement. After the First World War, Saad Zaghlul and the Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement, gaining a majority at the local Legislative Assembly. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to Malta on 8 March 1919, the country arose in its first modern revolution. Constant revolting by the Egyptian people throughout the country led Great Britain to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypt's independence on 22 February 1922.  The new Egyptian Government drafted and implemented a new constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary representative system. Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. In 1936 the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty  was concluded. Continued instability in the Government due to remaining British control and increasing political involvement by the king led to the ousting of the monarchy and the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'état known as the 1952 Revolution. The officers, known as the Free Officers Movement, forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad.  On 18 June 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by Gamal Abdel Nasser  the real architect of the 1952 movement  and was later put under house arrest. Nasser assumed power as President in June 1956. British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. His nationalization of the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956 prompted the 1956 Suez Crisis.  Three years after the 1967 Six Day War, during which Israel had invaded and occupied Sinai, Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat. Sadat switched Egypt's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972. He launched the Infitah economic reform policy, while violently clamping down on religious and secular opposition alike.  In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the October War, a surprise attack against the Israeli forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. It was an attempt to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier. Sadat hoped to seize some territory through military force, and then regain the rest of the peninsula by diplomacy. The conflict sparked an international crisis between the two world superpowers: the US and the USSR, both of whom intervened. Two UN-mandated ceasefires were needed to bring military operations to a halt. While the war ended with a military Israeli victory, it presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai in return for peace with Israel.  Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 peace treaty in exchange for the complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League, but it was supported by most Egyptians.  A fundamentalist military soldier assassinated Sadat in Cairo in 1981. He was succeeded by the incumbent Hosni Mubarak. In 2003, the Egyptian Movement for Change, popularly known as \"Kefaya,\" was launched to seek a return to democracy and greater civil liberties.</string>

Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana, who went on to dominate Mexican politics from 1833 to 1855. An 1821 treaty recognized Mexican independence from Spain and called for a constitutional monarchy. The planned monarchy failed; a republic was proclaimed in December 1822 and established in 1824.[PARAGRAPH:2]Throughout the rest of the 19th century, Mexico's government and economy were shaped by contentious debates among liberals and conservatives, republicans and monarchists, federalists and those who favored centralized government. During the two presidential terms of Benito Juarez (1858-71), Mexico experimented with modern democratic and economic reforms. President Juarez' terms of office, and Mexico's early experience with democracy, were interrupted by the Habsburg monarchy's rule of Mexico (1864-67), and was followed by the authoritarian government of Gen. Porfirio Diaz, who was president during most of the period between 1877 and 1911.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mexico's severe social and economic problems erupted in a revolution that lasted from 1910-20 and gave rise to the 1917 constitution.

Previously thought to exist only in Greek myths, the Minoans were discovered in 1900 by Sir Arthur Evans, a British archaeologist who was searching for King Minos' tomb at the site of Knossos on Crete. They used \"Linear A\" script to keep administrative records on tablets, but the ancient language remains large untranslated by historians.[PARAGRAPH:1:2]The Minoans are most closely associated with the myth of Theseus, the Minotaur, and the labyrinth. They are also well known for their maze-like palaces, which first appeared around 2000 BC. These unfortified palaces had a large open courtyard called the central court, and they may have been used as political, administrative, and/or economic centers based around storage and redistribution of agricultural goods. The four major Minoan palaces were Knossos, Phaistos, Zakro, and Mallia.[PARAGRAPH:1:2]Minoan art, architecture, and other forms of cultural expression show similarities to the civilizations of the Near East and Egypt. In particular, Minoans seem to have had a love of nature. Birds, cats, marine life, flowers, plants, and especially bulls are common images in frescos and on pottery. Women are also very popular in works of Minoan art and their pale skin distinguishes them from men, who were represented with darker skin tones.[PARAGRAPH:1:2]The Minoans are regarded as a peaceful, seafaring people who relied on overseas trade throughout the Mediterranean. Hence, the decline and eventual demise of the Minoan civilization still remains a mystery to archaeologists and historians.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_MOCHE_PEDIA">[TAB]The Moche civilization (alternately, the Mochica culture, Early Chimu, Pre-Chimu, Proto-Chimu, etc.) flourished in northern Peru from about 100 A.D. to 800 A.D., during the Regional Development Epoch. While still the subject of some debate, many scholars contend that the Moche were not politically organized as a monolithic empire or state but rather as a group of autonomous polities that shared a common elite culture as seen in the rich iconography and monumental architecture that survive today. They are particularly noted for their elaborately painted ceramics, gold work, monumental constructions (huacas) and irrigation systems. Moche history may be broadly divided into three periods - the emergence of the Moche culture in Early Moche (AD 100-300), its expansion and florescence during Middle Moche (AD 300-600), and the urban nucleation and subsequent collapse in Late Moche (AD 500-750). Moche society was agriculturally based with a significant level of investment in the diversion of river water into a network of irrigation canals. Their culture was sophisticated and their artifacts document their lives with detailed scenes of hunting, fishing, fighting, sacrifice, sexual encounters and elaborate ceremonies.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Moche cultural sphere is centered around several valleys on the north coast of Peru - Lambayeque, Jequetepeque, Chicama, Moche, Viru, Chao, Santa, and Nepena. The Huaca del Sol, a pyramidal adobe structure on the Rio Moche, had been the largest pre-Columbian structure in Peru; however, it was partly destroyed when Spanish Conquistadors mined its graves for gold. Fortunately the nearby Huaca de la Luna has remained largely intact - it contains many colorful murals with complex iconography and has been under excavation since the early 1990s. Other major Moche sites include Sipan, Pampa Grande, Loma Negra, Dos Cabezas, Pacatnamu, San Jose de Moro, the El Brujo complex, Mocollope, Cerro Mayal, Galindo, Huancaco, and Panamarca.[PARAGRAPH:2]There are several theories as to what caused the demise of the Moche political structure. Some scholars have emphasised the role of environmental change. Studies of ice cores drilled from glaciers in the Andes reveal climatic events between 536 to 594 AD, possibly a super El Nino, that resulted in 30 years of intense rain and flooding followed by 30 years of drought, part of the aftermath of the climate changes of 535-536.These weather events could have disrupted the Moche way of life and shattered their faith in their religion, which had promised stable weather through sacrifices[PARAGRAPH:2]However, it is clear that these events did not cause the final Moche demise. Recently discovered evidence suggests that the Moche polities survived beyond 650 AD in the Jequetepeque Valley and the Moche Valleys. For instance, in the Jequetepeque Valley, later settlements are characterized by fortifications and defensive works. While there is no evidence of a foreign invasion, as many scholars have suggested in the past (i.e. a Huari invasion), there is some evidence of social unrest, possibly the result of climatic changes as factions fought for control over scarce resources.</string>

Soon the pressures from European and Arab traders began to change the balance of power in the region.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Portuguese began their attempts to subdue the Shona state as early as 1505 but were confined to the coast for many years, according to Fernand Braudel until 1513.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Monomotapa Empire was being torn apart by rival factions, and the gold from the rivers they controlled was exhausted. The trade in gold was replaced by a trade in slaves. Around this time the Arab states of Zanzibar and Kilwa became prominent powers by providing slaves for Arabia, Persia and India.[PARAGRAPH:2]The empire was finally conquered in 1629 by the Portuguese and never recovered. Remnants of the government established another Mutapa kingdom in Mozambique sometimes called Karanga. The Karanga kings were called Mambos (plural version) and reigned in the region until 1902.[PARAGRAPH:2]The empire had another indirect side effect on the history of Southern Africa. Gold from the empire inspired in Europeans a belief that Munhumutapa held the legendary mines of King Solomon as referenced in the Bible. The belief that the mines were inside the Munhumutapa kingdom in Southern Africa was one of the factors that led to the Dutch East India Company founding the Cape colony, which would eventually lead to the creation of the country of South Africa.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_MYCENAE_PEDIA">[TAB]The Mycenaeans were warlike people who first entered the Greek peninsula around 1600 B.C.  Their culture evolved around Minoan culture because of their close trade relations.  Some Mycenaeans became seafaring traders, while some others remained warriors like their ancestors. [PARAGRAPH: 2]The Mycenaeans were organized into small kingdoms, each of which had its own hilltop fortress commanding the rest of the land.  The most impressive of these strongholds was Mycenae.  The fortress was contained a 40 foot stone wall that was over 26 feet thick.  This made the fortress virtually invincible.  Like Knossos of the Minoans, Mycenae might have been the seat of an overlord to whom the other rulers deferred.  Mycenaean fortresses were smaller than Minoan palaces but resembled them in other ways.  Within the fortress were workshops.  The king watched over ceremonies in the megaron.  The kings of Mycenae were buried in tombs with their important belongings.[PARAGRAPH: 2]The Mycenaeans are famous for their role in the downfall of Troy under the leadership of Agamemnon.  By 1450 B.C., the Mycenaeans were dominant in trading and raiding throughout the Mediterranean.  But by 1200 B.C., the Mycenaean civilization was on a decline.  Drought, civil war, invasions, or any combination of the three may have caused the collapse.  A dark age was upon the Aegean world, and seafarers from other places in the Mediterranean began to succeed Mycenae.</string>

The indigenous Maori named New Zealand Aotearoa, which is usually translated into English as The Land of the Long White Cloud. The Realm of New Zealand also includes the Cook Islands and Niue, which are self-governing but in free association; Tokelau; and the Ross Dependency (New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica).[PARAGRAPH:2]New Zealand is notable for its geographic isolation, being separated from Australia to the northwest by the Tasman Sea, approximately 2000 kilometres (1250 miles) across. Its closest neighbours to the north are New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga.[PARAGRAPH:2]The population is mostly of European descent, with the indigenous Maori being the largest minority. Asians and non-Maori Polynesians are also significant minorities, especially in the cities. Elizabeth II, as the Queen of New Zealand, is the Head of State and, in her absence, is represented by a non-partisan Governor-General. The Queen 'reigns but does not rule.' She has no real political influence, and her position is largely symbolic.[2] Political power is held by the democratically-elected Parliament of New Zealand under the leadership of the Prime Minister, who is the Head of Government.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_NORWAY_PEDIA">[TAB]The history of Norway before the age of the Vikings  is indistinct from that of the rest of Scandinavia. In the 9th cent. the country was still divided among the numerous petty kings of the fylker. Harold I, of the Yngling or Scilfing dynasty (which claimed descent from one of the old Norse gods), defeated the petty kings (c.900) and conquered the Shetlands and the Orkneys, but failed to establish permanent unity. Harold's campaigns drove many nobles and their followers to settle in Iceland and France. In the next two centuries Norsemen raided widely in W Europe and established the Norse duchy of Normandy. Harold himself concentrated on developing a dynasty; before he died (c.935) the country was divided among his sons, but one of them, Haakon I, defeated (c.935) his brothers and temporarily reunited the kingdom.  Christianity, brought by English missionaries, gained a foothold under Olaf I and was established by Olaf II (reigned 101528). Olaf II was driven out of Norway by King Canute of England and Denmark, in league with discontented Norwegian nobles; however, his son, Magnus I, was restored (1035) to the Norwegian throne. Both Magnus and his successor, Harold III, played a vital part in the complex events then taking place in England and Denmark. After Harold died while invading England (1066), Norway entered a period of decline and civil war, precipitated by conflicting claims to the throne.  Among the major events of 12th-century Norwegian history were the mission of Nicholas Breakspear (later Pope Adrian IV), who organized the Norwegian hierarchy, and the rule of Sverre, who created a new nobility grounded in commerce and, with the help of the popular party, the Birkebeiner, consolidated the royal power. His grandson, Haakon IV, was put on the throne by the Birkebeiner in 1217; under him and under Magnus VI (reigned 126380) medieval Norway reached its greatest flowering and enjoyed peace and prosperity. During this time Iceland and Greenland recognized Norwegian rule.The separate development of Norway was halted by the accession (1319) of Magnus VII, who was also king of Sweden. He was unpopular in Norway, which he was compelled to surrender (1343) to his son, Haakon VI, husband of Margaret I of Denmark. Margaret subsequently united the rule of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in her person and in 1397 had the Kalmar Union  drawn up. Although the union was strictly a personal one, Norway virtually ceased to exist as a separate kingdom and was ruled by Danish governors for the following four centuries. Its power had greatly declined even before Margaret's accession, however, and its trade had been taken over by the Hanseatic League, which maintained its chief northern office at Bergen.  Norway's political history became essentially that of Denmark. Christian III of Denmark (153559) introduced Lutheranism as the state religion. Under Danish rule Norway lost territory to Sweden but developed economically. The fishing industry flourished (late 17th cent.), lumbering became an important industry (18th cent.), the merchant class grew, and Norway became a naval power. During the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was blockaded by the British. In 1814, Denmark, which had sided with France, was obliged to consent to the Treaty of Kiel, by which it ceded Norway to the Swedish crown in exchange for W Pomerania.The Norwegians resisted union with Sweden and attempted to set up a separate kingdom, with a liberal constitution and a parliament, under Prince Christian (later King Christian VIII of Denmark). A Swedish army obliged Norway to accept Charles XIII of Sweden, but the act of union of 1814 recognized Norway as an independent kingdom, in personal union with Sweden, with its own constitution and parliament. Despite some Swedish concessions to growing Norwegian nationalism, Swedish-Norwegian relations were strained throughout the 19th cent. Johan Sverdrup, the Liberal leader, succeeded in making the ministry responsible to parliament despite royal opposition (1884), but other problems remained.  The Norwegian interest in obtaining greater participation in foreign policy came to a crisis in the late 19th cent. over the issue of a separate Norwegian consular service, justified by the spectacular growth of Norwegian shipping and commercial interests. Finally, in 1905, the Storting declared the dissolution of the union and the deposition of Oscar II. Sweden acquiesced after a plebiscite showed Norwegians nearly unanimously in favor of separation; in a second vote Norway chose to become a monarchy, and parliament elected the second son of Frederick VIII of Denmark king of Norway as Haakon VII.Two important features in Norwegian history of the late 19th and early 20th cent. were the large-scale emigration to the United States and the great arctic and antarctic explorations by such notable men as Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen. Three outstanding cultural figures of the period were Edvard Grieg, Henrik Ibsen, and Edvard Munch. In World War I, Norway remained neutral. The industrial development of Norway, spurred by the harnessing of water power, contributed to the rise of the Labor (socialist) party, which has predominated in Norwegian politics since 1927. In the 1930s much social welfare legislation was passed, including public health and housing measures, pensions, aid to the disabled, and unemployment insurance.  Norway attempted to remain neutral in World War II, but in Apr., 1940, German troops invaded, and in a short time nearly the whole country was in German hands. King Haakon and his cabinet set up a government in exile in London, and the Norwegian merchant fleet was of vital assistance to the Allies throughout the war. Despite the attempts of Vidkun Quisling to promote collaboration with the Germans, the people of Norway defied the occupation forces. German troops remained in Norway until the war ended in May, 1945. Although half of the Norwegian fleet was sunk during the war, Norway quickly recovered its commercial position. Postwar economic policy included a degree of socialism and measures such as price, interest, and dividend controls.  Norway was one of the original members of the United Nations (the Norwegian Trygve Lie was the first UN Secretary-General), and it became a member of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. King Olaf V succeeded to the throne in 1957. Norway joined the European Free Trade Association in 1959. Norwegian voters rejected membership in the European Community (now the European Union) in 1972, but trade agreements with the market were made the next year. Between 1965 and 1971 the Labor party was out of power for the first time since 1936.  The Labor party returned to power in 1971 under the leadership of Trygve Bratteli, whose government resigned but was restored to power in the 1973 elections. Bratteli was succeeded as prime minister by Odvar Nordli in 1976, who was quickly succeeded (1977) by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's first woman prime minister. Brundtland was defeated by Conservative Kåre Willoch in the 1981 election, but she returned to the office of prime minster in 1986 and 1990. In 1991, Harold V succeeded his father Olaf V as king of Norway.  Norway sparked international controversy in 1992 when it refused to conform to the International Whaling Treaty (see whaling). During 1993, the Norwegian government facilitated secret negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which led to agreements on Palestinian self-rule. Norwegian voters again rejected membership in the European Union (EU) in 1994. Bruntland resigned in 1996 and was replaced by Thorbjørn Jagland. Following elections in 1997, Jagland resigned and Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik became prime minister, heading a center-right coalition government that included the Center and Liberal parties. In Mar., 2000, Bondevik resigned after losing a key vote in parliament, and Labor party leader Jens Stoltenberg formed a new government. In parliamentary elections in Sept., 2001, Labor suffered a significant setback, with nonsocialist opposition parties winning a bare majority of the seats. Bondevik again became prime minister, heading a center-right minority government consisting of the Christian Democrat, Conservative, and Liberal parties. Parliamentary elections in Sept., 2005, brought Labor and its allies into office, and Stoltenberg became prime minister. The far-right Progress party, espousing a populist, anti-immigration platform, became the largest opposition party after the vote.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_NUBIA_PEDIA">[TAB]The first sign of inhabitants in the land now called Nubia was in the fifth millennium BC.  Various monuments of these early cultures can be found throughout parts of Eastern Africa and the Nile Valley.  Around 3800 BC, the first Nubian culture arose, known as the A Group.  Around 3300 BC, there is evidence of a unified kingdom that maintained interactions with the culture of Naqadan Upper Egypt.  This culture began to decline in the 28th century BC, when the B Group culture appeared.  The B Group is like the A Group, but poorer for reasons believed to be Egyptian invasions.  Nubia was a trade corridor between Egypt and tropical Africa. [PARAGRAPH: 2] In 2300 BC, Nubia was first mentioned in Old Kingdom Egyptian accounts of trade missions.  Trade with Egypt increased Nubia's wealth and stability as a nation.  By the Egyptian 6th Dynasty, Nubia was divided into a series of small kingdoms.  This C Group flourished from 2240 BC to 2150 BC.  During the Egyptian Middle Kingdom, it expanded into Nubia to gain control over the trade routes.  The Egyptians who lived in Nubia seemed to have peaceful relations with the people, but limited contact.  The next culture, the Pan Graves, lived along the East bank of the Nile River. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The first kingdom to unify much of the region arose, the Kingdom of Kerma, which was named after its capital at Kerma.  By 1760 BC, the kings organized various construction projects.  At one point, Kerma even came close to conquering Egypt.  However, as Egyptian power revived under the New Kingdom and expanded into Nubian lands, Kerma was destroyed and the new administrative center, Napata, was built. [PARAGRAPH: 2] When the Egyptians pulled out of Nubia, they left there cultural traditions, that mixed in with the previous traditions.  The Kingdom of Kush was then created, that adopted many Egyptian traditions, such as building pyramids.  Under the leadership of powerful leaders, Kush conquered Egypt and even outlasted it.  Eventually, they were conquered by the Assyrians and forced to migrate further south, establishing the new capital at Meroe.  The people of Meroe preserved many of their distinct customs, while still adapting Egyptian customs.  A famous Meroean incident is when their queen, Candace, held out against Alexander the Great who withdrew his troops.  Other powerful queens held out against the Romans.  Meroe would soon meet defeat by a new kingdom, Aksum, in the south. [PARAGRAPH: 2] After being occupied by the kingdom of Aksum, Nubia was divided into three smaller kingdoms: Nobatia, Makuria, and Alodia.  John of Ephesus records that a priest converted the king and his nobles of Nabatia to Christianity around 545.  He also wrote that Alodia was converted around 569.  The Kingdom of Makuria was apparently converted to Roman Catholicism around the same year.  By the 7th century, Makuria became the dominant power in the region.  It was strong enough to hold out against the southern expansion of Islam when the Arabs took Egypt.  A peace treaty was signed between the new rulers that lasted for six hundred years.  Over time, Islam migrated into Nubia and replaced Christianity.  [PARAGRAPH: 2] In the 14th century, the government collapsed and was dominated by Egypt.  By the end of colonialist, Nubia was divided between Egypt and Sudan.  Nubian villages can now be found north of Aswan and on Elephantine Island.  The Nubian people now live in large cities such as Cairo.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_OLMEC_PEDIA">[TAB]The Olmec were an ancient Pre-Columbian people living in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, roughly in what are the modern-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Their immediate cultural influence, however, extends far beyond this region. The Olmec flourished during the Formative (or Preclassic) period, dating from 1200 BC to about 400 BC, and are believed to have been the progenitor civilization of later Mesoamerican civilizations.[PARAGRAPH:2]Olmec history originated at its base within San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, where distinctively Olmec features begin to emerge before 1200 BC. The rise of civilization here was probably assisted by the local ecology of well-watered rich alluvial soil, encouraging high maize production. This ecology may be compared to that of other ancient centers of civilization: the Nile, Indus, and Yellow River valleys, and Mesopotamia. It is thought that the dense population concentration at San Lorenzo encouraged the rise of an elite class that eventually ensured Olmec dominance and provided the social basis for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture. Many of these luxury artifacts, such as jade, obsidian and magnetite, came from distant locations and suggest that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Mesoamerica. The source of the most valued jade, for example, is found in the Motagua River valley in eastern Guatemala, and their obsidian is mainly from sources also in the Guatemala highlands, such as El Chayal and San Martín Jilotepeque.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first Olmec center, San Lorenzo, was all but abandoned around 900 BC at about the same time that La Venta rose to prominence. Environmental changes may have been responsible for this move, with certain important rivers changing course. A wholesale destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments also occurred around this time, circa 950 BC, which may point to an internal uprising or, less likely, an invasion. Following the decline of San Lorenzo, La Venta became the most prominent Olmec center, lasting from 900 BC until its abandonment around 400 BC. During this period, the Great Pyramid and various other ceremonial complexes were built at La Venta.[PARAGRAPH:2]It is not known with any clarity what caused the eventual extinction of the Olmec culture. It is known that between 400 and 350 BC, population in the eastern half of the Olmec heartland dropped precipitously, and the area would remain sparsely inhabited until the 19th century. This depopulation was likely the result of environmental changes: perhaps the result of important rivers changing course or silting up due to agricultural practices. What ever the cause, within a few hundred years of the abandonment of the last Olmec cities, successor cultures had become firmly established. The Tres Zapotes site, on the western edge of the Olmec heartland, continued to be occupied well past 400 BC, but without the hallmarks of the Olmec culture. This post-Olmec culture, often labeled Epi-Olmec, has features similar to those found at Izapa, some 330 miles (550 km) to the southeast.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_PAKISTAN_PEDIA">[TAB]The modern state of Pakistan was established in 1947, but the region has an extensive ancient history that overlaps with the histories of Ancient India, Iran and Afghanistan. The region was a crossroads of historic trade routes, including the Silk Road, and was settled over thousands of years by many groups including Dravidians, Indo-Aryans, Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Kushans, White Huns, Afghans, Turks and Arabs. Historian and geographer de Blij Muller characterized quite aptly while describing the historical embodiment of the land when he said,\"If, as is so often said, Egypt is the gift of the Nile, then Pakistan is the gift of the Indus.\" The earliest evidence of humans is pebble tools of the Soan Culture in the Punjab province between 500,000 to 100,000 years ago. The Indus region was the site of several ancient cultures including Mehrgarh, one of the world's earliest towns, and the Indus Valley Civilisation at Harrappa and Mohenjo-Daro. The Indus Valley Civilisation collapsed in the middle of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the Vedic Civilisation which extended over much of northern India and Pakistan. Successive empires and kingdoms ruled the region from the Achaemenid Persian empire around 543 BCE, to Alexander the Great in 326 BCE and the Mauryan empire. The Indo-Greek Kingdom founded by Demetrius of Bactria included Gandhara and Punjab from 184 BCE, and reached its greatest extent under Menander, establishing the Greco-Buddhist period with advances in trade and culture. The city of Taxila (Takshashila) became a major centre of learning prior to the arrival of Islam - the ruins may still be seen within the Swat Valley, to the west of Islamabad.[PARAGRAPH:2]In AD 712, the Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Multan in southern Punjab, setting the stage for several successive Muslim empires including the Ghaznavid Empire, the Ghorid Kingdom, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. During this period Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional population to Islam. The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in the early eighteenth century provided opportunities for the Afghans, Balochis and Sikhs to exercise control over large areas until the British East India Company gained ascendancy over South Asia.[PARAGRAPH:2]17th Century Badshahi Masjid built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in LahoreThe 1857 War of Independence was the region's last major armed struggle against the British, but it laid the foundations for the generally unarmed freedom struggle led by the Congress. However the Muslim League rose to popularity in the late 1930's amid fears of under-representation and neglect of Muslims in politics. In 1930 Allama Iqbal called for a separate Muslim state in northwest and eastern South Asia. Muhammad Ali Jinnah espoused the Two Nation Theory and led the Muslim League to adopt the Lahore Resolution of 1940, which led to independence in 1947. [PARAGRAPH:2]Pakistan was formed on August 14, 1947 with two Muslim-majority wings in the eastern and northwestern regions of the South Asia, separated by Hindu-majority India, and comprising the provinces of Balochistan, East Bengal, the North-West Frontier Province, West Punjab and Sindh. The partition of British India resulted in communal riots across India and Pakistan-millions of Muslims moved to Pakistan and millions of Hindus and Sikhs moved to India. Disputes arose over several princely states including Jammu and Kashmir which led to the First Kashmir War (1948) ending with Pakistan and India each occupying large parts of the state. From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a Dominion in the Commonwealth of Nations. The republic declared in 1958 was stalled by a coup d'etat by Ayub Khan (1958-69), who was president during a period of internal instability and a second war with India in 1965. His successor, Yahya Khan (1969-71) had to deal with the cyclone which caused 500,000 deaths in East Pakistan.[PARAGRAPH:2]Economic and political dissent in East Pakistan led to violent political repression and tensions escalating into civil war (Bangladesh Liberation War) and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and ultimately the secession of East Pakistan as the independent state of Bangladesh. Civilian rule resumed from 1972 to 1977 under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, but he was deposed (and hanged to death in 1979 by court orders) by General Zia-ul-Haq, who became the third military president. The secular policies of the past were replaced by Zia's introduction of the Islamic Shariat legal code, and increased religious influences on the civil service and the military. Muhammad Khan Junejo was elected in 1985 as Prime Minister, but with the death of General Zia in a plane crash in 1988, Benazir Bhutto, daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan. Over the next decade, she alternated in power with Nawaz Sharif as the political and economic situation worsened.[PARAGRAPH:2]Military tensions in the Kargil conflict with India in 1999 were followed by a military coup in which General Pervez Musharraf assumed executive powers. In 2001, he became President after the resignation of Rafiq Tarar and after the 2002 parliamentary elections, transferred executive powers to newly elected Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali, who was succeeded in 2004 by Shaukat Aziz. On 8 October 2005, a powerful earthquake of magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the northern mountains of Pakistan and neighbouring regions in India and Afghanistan with the official death toll on 8 November standing at 87,350[20] and an estimated 3.3 million left homeless in Pakistan.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_PARTHIA_PEDIA">[TAB]In 247 BC, Arsak, or Arsaces as he was later known, leader of the Parni, a branch of the Dahae Scyths, was crowned king. This name may very well be his clan title rather than his given name. As we see in later Parthian times, the tradition of having a 'family' or tribal name was quite common among the Parthian nobles. Families of Suren, Karen, Espahbad, Naudar, and other Parthian noble families all carried their personal names as well as the above family names. Additionally, the tradition of having a regal name was also common from the Achaemenid times, as almost all Achaemenid emperors after Darius II seem to have chosen a dynastic name upon their accession.[NEWLINE][TAB]It was he who led his people south and overthrew the Seleukid governor of Parthia in 238 BC, this same governor, who was himself in revolt against his overlords. He would establish a kingdom that would last for almost 500 years. At the height of their power, the Parthians were second only to Rome and were the only civilized nation able to stand up to her.[NEWLINE][TAB]Parthia's beginnings were not easy. Arsaces I, initially controlled little more than Parthia, and neighbouring Hyrcania and they faced vigorous Seleukid attempts to recapture those lost dominions. In 226 BCE and again in 210 BCE, the Seleukids invaded in force. The Parthians retreated before them, only to return seizing yet more land when Seleukid attention fatally drifted towards the Hellenic western part of their empire. By the mid century things had changed. After a long war, the Parthian king Mithradates I had conquered Media and invaded Mesopotamia. This time, the Seleukid counterattack was fought and totally defeated. The Seleukid king Demetrios II, was captured and held prisoner, and upon his death Mithradates I ruled over Parthia, Hyrcania, Media, Babylonia, Assyria, Elymais and Persis. Parthia was now to be a world power.[NEWLINE][TAB]When the Parthian kingdom was founded in the mid 3rd century BC, it was made up of a small Scythian tribe, the Parni, and it's army was relatively small consisting chiefly of horse archers and the better armoured tribal chieftains. These skilled riders were served as part of the tribal host only in times of war. When the war was over, these warriors returned home with their loot to their everyday lives. As a result, their concepts of war was confined to raids and counter raids. Through out this period the Parthians remained a semi- nomadic people who made their living from horse and cattle breeding. However, contact with Persian style of warfare and the changing needs of a society no longer based on a nomadic lifestyle brought new concepts of warfare. This settled existence not only eroded their steppe culture but probably caused a rapid erosion of their horse and archery skills as well.[NEWLINE][TAB]Theoretically the Parthian king could call upon all those within the realm to serve in his armies. The Arascid king's major stumbling block was his own Azad nobles. The royal council was comprised the representatives of the Parthian clans, towns and vassal states. The only obligation some of these vassal states had to the Arascid dynasty was supplying troops for military service. However this council was effectively controlled by the lords of the Seven Great Clans. As a result the kings relied heavily on their own hereditary lands for the core of their armies. This was supplemented by Sakae nomadic mercenaries and those Nobles of the realm with a vested interest of advancing their fortunes by such service.[NEWLINE][TAB]Parthian armies had to operate in all types of terrain and climates from the hot flatlands of Aryavarta which would later be called India, the arid central plateau of Iran, the cold northern steppes and the high mountains of Armenia and Gandhara. Their enemies varied from slow-moving pikemen of the Hellenic armies to their nimble and swift kin from the eastern steppe. Parthian military thinking was therefore based on the ideas of mobility, adaptability and self-sufficiency, it could be no other way. The plan of any battle was the Cataphract charge, a massed attack knee-to-knee by heavy cavalry, the light horse archers supported this by probing for weak points to be exploited with concentrated archery. The archers did terrible damage to massed troops and this would force the enemy to disperse. If they did so, they left themselves exposed to the charge of the heavy Cataphracts. With the light and heavy cavalry deployed, the Pahlavan cavalry was able to bring down of one form of attack, or the other as the situation dictated. It was this tactic that shattered the Roman legions at the battle of Carrhae.[NEWLINE][TAB]The tribal host formed the bulk of the Parthian army and would have provided the bulk of the Hamspah or levies, mounted archers and the infantry levy. Each clan Family mustered under their Wuzurgan grandees and the lesser Azadan leaders, bringing with them retainers from their lands and these would fight together in the same units. They used probably the best weapon for the horseman, which was the composite horse bow. This was similar to the simple bow but used multiple types of wood, horn and sinew to produce a stronger bow with a greater draw weight, the force built up in the string that will propel the arrow forward to its target.[NEWLINE][TAB]The wars between the Greeks and the Persians and final Alexandrian conquest showed the Pahlava that lightly armed infantry could not stop heavy, well-trained, infantry of the type employed by the Greeks and later Romans. They themselves had a healthy contempt for such light infantry in their many raids of more civilized lands. These heavy infantry could only be countered with heavily armed cataphracts and tough veteran horse archers able to cause disorder in the massed ranks and then attacking vulnerable points with archery and lance. This was a lesson they learned well and would prove on the field of battle. The Romans and Greeks came to respect the Parthian in a way they never respected the Persian.[NEWLINE][TAB]The Parthian Kingdom was smaller than that of the Achaemenid Persians, and closer in many ways to later european feudal states. There was for example no standing army, just as in feudal europe. There were of course the garrisons of the Hellenic Polis and vital forts were garrisoned. The armed retinues of the Wuzurgan grandees, the Azadan minor nobility, Zandbed and Dehbed tribal chiefs, along with the local kings, Sahrdaran, and princes of royal blood, the Waspuhragan.[NEWLINE][TAB]The Great King as Sar-Xwaday, Overlord, appealed to his subordinate kings, the Sahrdaran, the Azad nobles, garrison commanders, and most importantly the tribal lords to muster what they could and bring them to an appointed place at a given time. The assembled host would be placed under the command of a Spahbed or general, trusted by the Great King. The core of the army, or Spad was the feudal or tribal nobility. Accustomed to hard riding from an early age and skilled in archery and skirmishing, the Pahlavan cavalry would come to be known as something to fear. Their name echoes in eternity as the term Pahlavan, means Hero in Persian.[NEWLINE][TAB]The Pahlavan nation was ever under threat, and they never suffered for a lack of enemies. The North Iranian nomads, the Dahae, Sakae, and Sauromatae constantly threatened the eastern borders while in the west first the Seleukids and then the Romans were ever ready for full scale war. Few nations have ever faced such a combination of enemies and finding an army that would both was no easy matter. Rapid mobility was essential for no slow moving army could possibly match the light cavalry of the nomads to the north. Infantry were not very useful in such a situation and not worth what Romans or Greeks paid for them. The answer was the Asabaran, pronounced Asavaran in Parthian. The Parthians did have foot soldiers and when large numbers of Greeks or Romans were captured they had no hesitation in putting them to use. They could however never be more than a small part of the Parthian army. They could not afford to maintain a massive army of heavy infantry to counter the nomadic cavalry, nor could the Romans, who when faced with this same situation, took to the same solution.[NEWLINE][TAB]The mainstay of the infantry were foot archers. These foot archers almost certainly represented the poorer elements of the various infantry levies of Parthia. The tradition of mounted archery in Parthia and the northern steppe peoples makes it almost inevitable that a massed levy would produce significant numbers of foot archers as well.[NEWLINE][TAB]When Persia was conquered by Alexander the Great, Alexander originally attempt to bring a fusion of Persian and Greek culture. However this attempt at a fusion was to collapse upon his death, and lead to the alienation of the Persian elite and the rejection of Greek culture by the Persians. In Persia kingship and religion were tied together in a way that the Greeks poorly understood. The world had been created by Ahura Mazda and it was he who ordained the monarch. There were those who responded to the appeal of Hellenism but as elsewhere it was associated with a secular spirit repulsive to most near eastern peoples. However, it is also true that Alexander destroyed Zoroastrian sanctuaries, persecuted priests and destroyed religious writings. In doing so the 'accursed Alexander' created an army of priests who saw Hellenism as the enemies. In addition to their religious duties, these priests served as judges, tax collectors and scribes. They were in a unique position to do harm to the Greek cause in Iran.[NEWLINE][TAB]Traditional Zoroastrianism was revived slowly under the Parthian, or Arsacid, dynasty, which ruled from about 250 bc to ad 224. By the time of the Sassanid dynasty, from ad 224 to 651, Zoroastrianism had become the popular religion among most groups in Iran and Central Asia and was practiced from the Middle East to the western border of China.[NEWLINE][TAB]Their empire began to decline in the 2nd century AD, as Parthia was chronically weakened by internal struggle, and the rebellion of Ardashir of Persis in 220 AD sounded its death knell. Such bloody conflicts were not uncommon within the ruling Arsacid family and the loyalty of the great noble lords was often dubious. The last Parthian king, Artabanos IV, was killed in the battle of Hormuzdagan in 224 AD and Ardashir was crowned as the first Sassanid king. The first acts of the Sassanid dynasty was the systematic destruction of everything Parthian and under the hammer and fire of Sassanid fury went the records of what had once been a proud nation.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_PHILIPPINES_PEDIA">[TAB]Archeological and paleontological discoveries show that Homo sapiens existed in Palawan circa 50,000 BC. The aboriginal people of the Philippines, the Negritos, are an Australo-Melanesian people, which arrived in the Philippines at least 30,000 years ago.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Philippines had trade relations with China and Japan, and strong cultural ties with India through neighboring present-day Malaysia and Indonesia as early as the ninth to twelfth centuries. Islam was brought to the Philippines by traders and proselytizers from Malaysia and Indonesia. Muslim immigrants introduced a political concept of territorial states ruled by rajas or sultans who exercised suzerainty over the datu. Neither the political state concept of the Muslim rulers nor the limited territorial concept of the sedentary rice farmers of Luzon, however, spread beyond the areas where they originated. When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the majority of the estimated 500,000 people in the islands lived in barangay settlements.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the service of Spain, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and his crew started their voyage on September 20, 1519. Magellan sighted Samar on March 17, 1521, on the next day, they reached Homonhon. They reached the island of Limasawa on March 28, 1521 where the first Mass in the Philippines was celebrated on March 31, 1521. Magellan arrived at Cebu on April 7, 1521, befriending Rajah Humabon and converting his family and 700 other Cebuanos to Christianity. However, Magellan would later be killed in the Battle of Mactan by indigenous warriors led by Lapu-Lapu, a fierce rival of Humabon. The beginnings of colonization started to take form when Philip II of Spain ordered successive expeditions. Miguel López de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 and formed the first Spanish settlements in Cebu. In 1571 he established Manila as the capital of the new Spanish colony.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Spanish-American War began in Cuba in 1898 and soon reached the Philippines when Commodore George Dewey defeated the Spanish squadron at Manila Bay. Aguinaldo declared the independence of the Philippines on June 12, 1898, and was proclaimed head of state. As a result of its defeat, Spain was forced to officially cede the Philippines, together with Cuba (made an independent country, the US in charge of foreign affairs), Guam and Puerto Rico to the United States. In 1899 the First Philippine Republic was proclaimed in Malolos, Bulacan but was later dissolved by the US forces, leading to the Philippine-American War between the United States and the Philippine revolutionaries, which continued the violence of the previous years. The US proclaimed the war ended when Aguinaldo was captured by American troops on March 23, 1901, but the struggle continued until 1913 claiming the lives of over a million Filipinos. The country's status as a territory changed when it became the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935, which provided for more self-governance.[PARAGRAPH:2]Since 1946, the newly independent Philippine state has faced political instability with various rebel groups. Ferdinand Marcos was, then, the elected president. Barred from seeking a third term, Marcos declared martial law on September 21, 1972, under the guise of increased political instability and resurgent Communist and Muslim insurgencies, and ruled the country by decree. In January 1986, Marcos allowed for a snap election, after large protests. The election was believed to be fraudulent, and resulted in a standoff between military mutineers and the military loyalists. Protesters supported the mutineers, and were accompanied by resignations of prominent cabinet officials. Corazon Aquino, the widow of Benigno Aquino, Jr., was the recognized winner of the snap election. She took over the government, and called for a constitutional convention to draft a new constitution, after the People Power Revolution. Marcos, his family and some of his allies fled to Hawaii.[PARAGRAPH:2]The return of democracy and government reforms after the events of 1986 were hampered by massive national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, a communist insurgency, and a Muslim separatist movement.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_PHOENICIA_PEDIA">[TAB]From 1200 to 800 BC the Semitic-speaking Phoenicians lived and prospered on the Mediterranean coast north of Palestine. Their chief cities were Tyre and Sidon. They gained fame as sailors and traders. They occupied a string of cities along the Mediterranean coast, in what is today Lebanon and Syria.[PARAGRAPH:2]The coastal land, though narrow, was fertile and supported farming. Still, the resourceful Phoenicians became best known for manufacturing and trade. They made glass from coastal sand. From a tiny sea snail, they produced a widely admired purple dye, called \"Tyrian purple\" after the city of Tyre, which became their trademark. It became the favorite color of royalty.[PARAGRAPH:2]Phoenicians also used papyrus from Egypt to make scrolls, or rolls of paper, for books. The words Bible and bibliography come from the Phoenician city of Byblos. Phoenicians traded with people all around the Mediterranean Sea. To promote trade, they set up colonies from North Africa to Sicily and Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]Due to their sailing skills, the Phoenicians served as missionaries of civiliization, bringing eastern Mediterranean products and culture to less advanced peoples. A few Phoenician traders braved the stormy Atlantic and sailed as far as England. There, they exchanged goods from the Mediterranean for tin. About 600 BC, one Phoenician expedition may have sailed down the Red Sea and then followed the African coast around the southern tip. That historic voyage was forgotten for centuries. (In the late 1400's, Europeans claimed to be the first to round the southern tip of Africa.)[PARAGRAPH:2]As merchants, the Phoenicians needed a simple alphabet to ease the burden of keeping records. They therefore replaced the cumbersome cuneiform alphabet of 550 characters with a phonetic alphabet, based on distinct sounds, consisting of 22 letters. After further alterations by the Greeks and Romans, this alphabet became the one we use today.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_PICTS_PEDIA">[TAB]Those familiar with the Celts divide them up into three categories: the Scottish, the Irish, and the Welsh. However, for a long time there was another group called the Picts who were, for centuries, the most powerful inhabitants of the British Isles. Today however, much about them remains a mystery, with hardly any record of them after the mid-9th century AD.[PARAGRAPH:2]Pictland, as the Pictish homeland was called, was made up of a large area of what is now modern day Scotland, mainly in the low-lying coastal areas of Eastern Scotland where they sustained themselves through fishing and farming. The Picts weren't any one particular race or culture per se, but a military alliance which was formed around 100 AD to defend against the Roman invaders. The name Pict itself is believed to be derived from the Latin word Picti, \"the painted men\". In fact, the Pictish nation out-lasted the would-be conquerors and predated the formal organization of both the Scots and Irish. Historical and archaeological records also show that they were also quite fierce warriors, judging by accounts of those (like the Scots and the Irish) whom they defeated in battle. They were the dominant military power in that area for almost 500 years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Almost all of what is now known about them is from accounts of others and the few artifacts the Picts themselves left behind. Chief among these were ornate carved stones which represent some of the high points of Celtic art. There are inscriptions on the stones written in an alphabet called Ogham, variations of which were also used by the Scots and Irish. Although the inscriptions of their Celtic counterparts have been translated, there has yet to be any successful translation of the Pictish Ogham.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite their lack of written records, the Picts were quite advanced culturally and artistically. Between the 5th and 7th centuries AD most of them were converted to Christianity and this was reflected in the sculptures of the period. Their art retained most of its traditional elements, but they also began to add crosses and other Christian symbolism.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Picts shared much in common with their fellow Celts, such as geography, similar language, and similar art, among other things. There were some differences however, the main one being that descent for the Picts was defined in terms of the mother rather than the father ie. matrilineal rather than patrilineal. Historical records suggest that this is what led to their disappearance, or rather their assimilation by the Scots. Because of the way in which Picts handled descent, the Scots were able to gradually absorb them through marriage. After some time, it is believed, all distinction between them had become so blurred that they were essentially indistinguishable.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although it is generally accepted by historians and archaeologists that the Picts merged with the Scots, exact details aren't known. And with the exception of second hand accounts, there is almost no information about the Picts themselves. Because of their unique social and historical characteristics, the Picts have continued to be one of history's most intriguing mysteries.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_PILIWNI_PEDIA">[TAB]\"Piliwni\" means people in the Me-wauk language.[PARAGRAPH:2] Great Basin[PARAGRAPH:2]Between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada mountain ranges of California lies an arid and sparsely populated land largely consisting of desert. The land also features valleys, some with oases, and large hills as many as 5,000 feet high. Water and food were hard to come by in most of the area. Included in the Great Basin culture area are the Tubatulabal and the Owens Valley Paiute of eastern California and the Paiute, southern Shoshone and western Ute in the Great Basin of Nevada and Utah, among others. [PARAGRAPH:2]The area was generally too dry for farming and there were relatively few animals to hunt. Therefore, most of the natives subsisted on seeds and nuts, which they collected as they roamed about. The Paiute and Shoshone gathered the sweet nuts of the piñon tree. Other natives gathered seeds from such plants as the pigweed and primose. When they could, these seed-gathering natives killed deer and antelope, and caught rabbits in the sagebrush. A few tribes ate boiled or roasted grasshoppers. [PARAGRAPH:2]Given that food was scarce, they had to stay on the move to find it. Most of these natives trekked over the countryside on a routine route every year, gathering seeds as they ripened. Because of this, their dwellings were temporary. Every family had up to three camps to visit in a year. The natives made a shelter by putting up a frame of poles in a round or beehive shape. They had no bark or skins to cover the shelter, so they tied bundles of grass or desert bushes to it. They heaped earth over the house in winter. The inhabitants of the California and Intermountain regions used shells as currency, which eased trade among their several societies. [PARAGRAPH:2]California[PARAGRAPH:2]The California region boasts a wide variety of climates and geographical features, rivaling any other area of comparable dimensions. Nearly all but the eastern-edge California Native Americans lived where environmental conditions were favorable, making food relatively accessible. Along the Pacific Coast, they hunted fish and sea mammals by boat. Included were such California tribes as the Chumash, Yurok and Pomo. The Maidu and Pomo principally ate acorns, which have a higher calorie rating than wheat. They pounded the hard nuts with stones and washed out the bitter taste with water. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Pomo crafted what were arguably the finest baskets in all of indigenous America. They made baskets as small as a thimble and as big as a yard in width. They made watertight baskets for cooking acorn mush and seed gruel, as well as for carrying and storing food. They wove especially beautiful baskets for presents and as offerings to forebears. Some were bedecked with colorful bird feathers and shells. Their skill also was applied to trays, boats, headgear and baby carriers, such as a wickerwork cradleboard in which an infant spent his first year. Their mothers wore hats that resembled bowl-shape baskets. [PARAGRAPH:2]The California natives lived in communities numbering up to 2,000 with dwellings arrayed in groups. A house consisted of a round frame covered with grass. There was a skylight in the roof and the beds were made on skin-covered frames-each with a partition for privacy. In the center of the floor, they made a cook fire for seeds, nuts, fish and other foods. More than 100 languages flourished in California before European contact; most are gone today. [PARAGRAPH:2] In this modification for CivIV by Wyz_sub10, the Great Basin and Californian cultures include the Paiute, Mohave, Hupa and Ute groups among many others.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_POLAND_PEDIA">[TAB]Throughout Late Antiquity, many distinct ethnic groups occupied the regions of what is now Poland.  Many Slavic, Celtic, Baltic, and Germanic tribes were among the prominent groups.  The most famous archeological find from the prehistory of Poland is the Biskupin fortified settlement.  The fort has been dated to the early Iron Age, when the Lusatian culture occupied the area around 700 BC. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Poland began to take the form of a unified country around the middle of the tenth century under the Piast dynasty.  Catholic Christianity was the nation's first official religion.  In the twelfth century, Poland split into several smaller states.  Under the Jagiellon dynasty, Poland forged an alliance with its neighbor, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  Polish economy, military, and culture flourished in Poland-Lithuania and under the Jagiellons.  Poland was famous for its tolerance for all religions, and thus became a center for the migration of the Jewish people.  [PARAGRAPH: 2] A golden age resulted in the country from the newly established Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.  The nobility of Poland, which were more abundant than in other Western European countries, took pleasure in the parliamentary system.  During its Golden Age, Poland expanded its borders to become the largest country in Europe.  However, in the middle of the seventeenth century, a Swedish invasion and Cossack's Chmielnicki Uprising marked the end of its golden age.  Wars against Russia also marked the country's decline.  The reforms, specifically the Great Sejm, the second modern constitution of the world, were dissatisfied with the three partitions of Poland, which began Poland's being removed from the map and its territories being divided among Russia, Prussia, and Austria. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The Poles would resent their fate and would rebel several times against the partitioners.  In 1807, Napoleon created the Duchy of Warsaw, but after the Napoleonic wars, Poland was divided again.  The Russian Czars who ruled the country eventually reduced the Polish freedoms, and Russia captured the country.  After the invasions of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, Poland was split under Germany and the Soviet Union.  Poland lost much of its citizens in the war, six million and at least half Polish Jews.  After the borders were shifted following World War II, many people of Poland were forced to migrate. [PARAGRAPH: 2] The Soviet Union introduced a new Communist government in Poland.  The People's Republic of Poland was officially proclaimed in 1952.  However, in 1956, people received more freedoms and were freed from prisons after Poland became more liberal.  In 1980, an independent trade union overcame the Communist Party and bared the collapse of communism across Eastern Europe.  Following these changes, Poland made numerous improvements in human rights.  In May 1, 2004, Poland became a full member of the European Union.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_POLYNESIA_PEDIA">[TAB] Polynesia comprises of the island groups of Samoa, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, and Niue, the islands of Tokelau, Tuvalu, Tonga, Wallis, Futuna, Hawaii, and Pitcairn Island.  The original inhabitants of New Zealand, the Maori, are also considered Polynesian.  The island of Fiji is sometimes included in Polynesia because of its high percentage of Polynesian inhabitants.  Archaeological evidence supports that Polynesia was settled by migration from Melanesia beginning about 3,000 to 4,000 years ago.  The Samoans are believed to have settled the Marquesas perhaps as early as 300 AD, and Easter Island may have been settled from the Marquesas as early as 400 AD.  Hawaii was also settled by these voyagers during the second half of the first millennium AD, and then the Society Islanders, who were the point of origin for the Polynesians who settled on Cook Island.  Around 1000 AD, these cultures also inhabited Polynesia. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Prior to European contact, Polynesian settlements were either in hamlets or villages.  Houses were clustered in small groups, and villages contained 30 or more houses.  These villages were primarily found on the islands of Samoa and New Zealand and were often fortified by walls of stone or wooden palisades.  Both of these types of settlements relied on family oriented organization.  The most common type of organization was that power passed from the first born son to firstborn son and so on.  In Polynesian societies, chiefs would be revered as equals to others.  However, they could usually trace their family line back to the creator gods.  In societies where the chief was protected and separate from the people, warfare was common.  Christian missionaries succeeded in overthrowing ancient religious practices only after they had converted the chiefs. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Religion and magic played an important role in Polynesian culture.  Each of the gods had their own rituals, which were carried out by the priests.  Among these practices were sacrifice, chanting, feasting, and fertility rites.  Magic was also enveloping, and countless rituals regarding love, war, revenge, agriculture, and fishing were practiced.  Polynesian culture was a largely marine based.  In addition to fish, mollusks and crustaceans were an important source of food.  Fishing was usually a group activity, and Polynesian fishermen explored the vast expanses of ocean around their homes.  Other food could be provided by various plants. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Food plants also provided materials for various reasons.  Breadfruit wood was used in canoe making, for instance, and leaves of some plants were used in weaving mats, clothing, sails, and other household goods.  Both single and double canoes were equipped with mat sails.  Some boats were large enough to transport families, domesticated animals, and plants over long stretches of ocean.  Over time, cultures developed distinct artistic skills.  Ruined stone temples can be found in the Society Islands, Easter Island, and the Marquesas culture.  Good such as canoes, war clubs, shields, and fish hooks were elaborately decorated.  Feather cloaks showed an enormous amount of effort in gathering rare feathers and arranging them in intricate designs. [PARAGRAPH: 2] Contact with European culture began in the late 1700s and radically changed Polynesia.  Spanish explorers were eager to search for riches and spread Christianity.  The Dutch and British also explored areas such as New Zealand and the Samoan islands.  Resistance to European intervention occurred in almost all of the Polynesian islands, but such movements were brief.  For much time to come, Polynesia would go under the power of European powers and the United States.  Polynesian culture, however, always remained in these islands.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_ROMANIA_PEDIA">[TAB]Romanians trace their history back to 300 B.C. But Romania did not become an independent, unified country until 1861. During most of the time in-between, various foreign peoples ruled all or part of Romania.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the years from 300 to 200 B.C., Dacian people farmed, mined gold and iron ore, and traded with neighboring peoples.  Romania was called \"Dacia\" during this period. The Romans, under Emperor Trajan, conquered Dacia in A.D. 106, and made it a province of the Roman Empire. Roman soldiers occupied Dacia, and Roman colonists settled there. The Romans intermarried with the Dacians, who adopted Roman customs and the Latin language. Dacia became known as Romania because of the Roman occupation and influence.[PARAGRAPH:2]Barbarians from the east and north began invading Romania during the 2nd century A.D. They forced the Romans to abandon the province in the late 200's. The invasions were to continue off and on until the 1100's. The invaders included Bulgars, Goths, Huns, Magyars, Slavs, and Tartars. These groups, especially the Slavs, intermarried with the Romanians.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Romanian nobles made several attempts to gain freedom from the Ottoman Empire. As a result, in the early 1700s, the empire sent wealthy Greeks to govern the principalities. These Greeks were called Phanariots because they came from the Phanar district of Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey). They taxed the peasants far more than ever before and treated them harshly. Phanariot rule lasted until 1821, when a revolt by Romanians forced the Ottomans to remove the Greeks from power. Many scholars believe that Romania's peasants never suffered more than they did during the Phanariot period.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Russians took over next. During the late 1700s, the Ottoman Empire suffered a series of military defeats at the hands of Russia. Little by little, the Ottomans lost parts of their empire. Officially, Ottoman rule of the principalities lasted until 1878. But, in effect, it ended in 1829, when Russian troops occupied the principalities. Russia drew up a constitution for the principalities in the early 1830s. The constitution, called \"Organic Statutes,\" gave governing power in each principality to an assembly of nobles. This marked the beginning of representative government in Romania. Russia's troops withdrew from the principalities in 1834. The idea of uniting Moldavia and Walachia existed almost from the time the principalities were founded. The unification movement grew rapidly during the mid-1800s. In 1859, the assemblies of the two principalities elected Prince Alexander John Cuza as their common ruler. In 1861, the principalities officially united to form a nation called Romania. In 1878, the major nations of Europe officially recognized Romania's full independence from Turkey. In 1881, Romania became a kingdom, and Carol became King Carol I.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the start of Carol's reign, Romania's first political parties were established, and the people were given the right to elect their government representatives. But a complex election system kept the peasants from having many representatives. Romania's economy improved under Carol. Wealthy Romanians benefited from the economic growth, but the peasants gained little from it. In 1907, Romania's peasants revolted. They burned the houses and destroyed the crops of many wealthy landowners. The Romanian Army put down the revolt, killing at least 10,000 peasants. Carol died in 1914, and his nephew Ferdinand became king.[PARAGRAPH:2]World War I was fought from 1914 to 1918. Romania remained neutral at first. But in 1916, it joined France, Great Britain, and the other Allies in their fight against the Central Powers (chiefly Austria-Hungary and Germany). Romania wanted to gain Banat, Bukovina, and Transylvania--three provinces of Austria-Hungary that had large Romanian populations. The Allies won the war, and Romania received the territories it wanted as part of the peace settlement. As a result, Romania about doubled in size and population. For the first time, Romania's territory included almost all the land where large numbers of Romanians lived.[PARAGRAPH:2]World War II ended in 1945, and the Allies took northern Transylvania from Hungary and returned it to Romania. The Soviet Union and Bulgaria kept the Romanian territory they had taken. The Communists declared Romania an \"independent people's democracy.\" But Romania was a Soviet satellite (country controlled by the Soviet Union). In 1948 and 1952, Romania adopted constitutions that praised the Soviet Union. Romania's government, educational system, and other institutions were modeled on those of the Soviet Union. Soviet leaders directed Romania's economy and forced the country to emphasize agriculture and neglect industry. They also set foreign policy.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ceausescu's government maintained an extensive system of restrictions on the lives of the people. In mid-December 1989, thousands of people in the city of Timisoara staged demonstrations, calling for greater freedom from the Communist government and for an improved standard of living. Government security forces responded to the protests by firing on the people and killing hundreds. Antigovernment protests then spread across Romania. In Bucharest, tens of thousands gathered in the streets and called for increased freedoms and the resignation of Ceausescu. Security forces fired on the crowds, bringing the death toll of demonstrators into the thousands. Army units joined the revolt, and fierce fighting between the army and Ceausescu's security forces followed.[PARAGRAPH:2]On December 22, Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled Bucharest during a massive antigovernment demonstration. However, they were soon captured by the army. A secret trial took place and Ceausescu and his wife were charged with murder and embezzlement of government funds. They were found guilty and were executed on December 25. [PARAGRAPH:2]Much discussion is currently focused on the decision by Romania's government to join the European Union (EU). </string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_SCOTLAND_PEDIA">[TAB]The earliest settlement in Scotland may date from as early as 4000 B.C.  Many large structures remain from the later part of the New Stone Age.  The Romans attempted to suppress the militaristic northern tribes.  Eventually, they withdrew south of Hadrian's Wall, which they completed in the year 128 across northern England.  The Picts and Scots, along the Britons, Angles, and the Vikings, all contributed to the establishment of a Scottish kingdom by the 10th and 11th centuries.  [PARAGRAPH: 1] The early years of Scotland's kingdom was characterized by violence.  Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" is an example.  In the story, the Scottish king Duncan I is killed by his general Macbeth and his son, Malcolm III, succeeds to the throne.  The 13th century was more peaceful.  However, in 1290, Scottish lords fought over the succession to the throne.  England's King Edward tried but failed to install a king into the Scottish throne.  He then invaded Scotland and declared himself overlord.  The Scots rose against Edward I under the leadership of a great hero, Sir William Wallace.  After Wallace's execution, the revolt continued under the leadership of Robert the Bruce, the leading candidate for the throne.  He was crowned King Robert I in 1306.  He defeated the English at Bannockburn in 1314, and in 1328, the English signed a treaty recognizing Scotland's independence.  [PARAGRAPH: 1] Robert's son David II died childless.  Several nobles struggled for the throne, and the Stuart noble family won.  Robert II, the first Stuart king, was crowned in 1371.  A later Stuart king, James I, and his son James II strengthened the central government.  During this time, trade flourished and universities were founded.  Scotland was usually allied with France against England during these years.  In 1502, James IV tried to strengthen Scotland's ties with England by marrying Margaret Tudor.  Margaret was the daughter of King Henry VII.  But conflicts between James and Henry VIII led to border war.  James was killed at the Battle of Flodden Field in 1513 and was succeeded by his son, James V. [PARAGRAPH: 1] One of Scotland's most famous rulers, Mary, Queen of Scots, James V's daughter, ruled at this time.  She was the last monarch of a separate Scottish kingdom.  In 1603 her son James VI succeeded to the throne of England and Ireland as James I.  With the Act of Union in 1707, England, Ireland, and Scotland were united under one parliament and ruler.  Wales was already under English rule at this time.  Meanwhile, the Scots continued to maintain their own identity. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Ever since the Scots ceased to govern themselves, generations of Scottish nationalists have called for an independent state.  More moderate people have supported devolution, which would return power over to local affairs to an elected Scottish legislature in Edinburgh while leaving foreign affairs in the hands of the British parliament.  A vote on devolution failed in 1979, but another succeeded overwhelmingly in 1997 and home rule was finally approved.  Elections to the new Scottish Parliament were scheduled in 1999.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_SCYTHIA_PEDIA">[TAB]\"What sort of men are these!?\" That question must have perplexed the Persian leader Darius when, in the midst of battle, he watched his Scythian enemies abandon the serious business of war in order to take off suddenly in chase of a hare they had spied. Well the same query persists in the minds of modern civilized men as scholarship adds to what we know about this strange custom of Eurasia's mounted nomad. New research and thousands of examined burial sites in the last Panticipaeum years in South Russia and the Altai have helped us to paint a much fuller picture of this vigorous nomad people with their unique animal art and love of the horse - an extraordinary race from whom the civilized world learned to wear trousers and riding horses.[PARAGRAPH:2]Perhaps the most striking feature of Scythians was the enormous amount of gold they wore and used. The ancient legend tells the story about the one-eyed people, Arimaspians in Scythia who had on-going battle with the griffins who guarded the gold. This gold undoubtedly came from the rich fields in the Altai district. It is common that the Scythians wore golden ornaments and belts. Gold plates were sewn to their garments and gold gleamed from their weapons. The archaeologists are consistently amazed by the amount of gold offerings deposited in the great burial- mounds of the Scythian kings.[PARAGRAPH:2]Where had they come from? The Scythians themselves had a legend that they sprang from the three sons of certain Targitaus, a person of supernatural birth who dwelled in the Black Sea domain. Together the three brothers ruled the land until four golden implements - a plow, a yoke, a battle-ax and a drinking cup - fell from the sky and suddenly began to blaze. Colaxais, the youngest, proved to be the only one of the brothers who could pick up the burning objects, and thus became sole ruler of the Scythian kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Another Scythian creation story was told by the ancient Diodorus Siculus at the 1st century BC According to Diodorus, Scythians \"lived in very small numbers at the Araks River....that they gained for themselves a country in the mountains up to the Caucasus, in the lowland on the coast of the Ocean (Caspian Sea) and the Meot Lake (Azov Sea) and other territories up to the Tanais River (Don River). Born in that land from the conjugal union of Zeus and a snake-legged goddess was a son Scyth who gave the name Scythian to the people.\" His descendants were named Pal and Naps and were the ancestors of two congenetic people - pals and naps. \"They won for themselves a country \"behind the Tanais River up to the Egyptian Nile River\".[PARAGRAPH:2]Dating the earliest Scythians has been a problem since they did not develop their distinctive art style until the 6th century BC A. I. Melyukova suggested that the early Scythians were descendants of tribes of the Srubnaya culture who, between the middle of the 2nd millenium BC and the end of the 7th century BC, moved in several waves from the Volga-Ural steppes into the north Black Sea area and assimilated the local Cimmerians. In history, the Scythians was first recorded in the 7th century BC as Assyria's ally against the Cimmerians, who had lost their homeland to the Scythians and moved south. The Scythian king, Partatua married an Assyrian princess in 674 BC and two nations remained allies. Scythians and Assyrians together conquered the Medes of the Caspian Sea; however the Medes was able to drive the Scythians out of western Asia and back to the Pontic Steppes by the turn of the century.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first mounted nomads to attract the attention of historians were the Scythians. If the Scythians were not the first to domesticate the horse they were among the earliest, if not the first of the Central Asian people to learn to ride it. Mounted soldiers was the Scythians' success in war; so when they penetrated into Asia, the technique of riding was rapidly adopted and mastered throughout the entire Middle Eastern area.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Scythians were famous for their bloody tribal custom. Warriors not only cut off the heads of slain enemies but also made leather-bound drinking cups from their enemies' skulls. They lined these grisly trophies with gold and proudly displayed them to impress their guests. Prolonged and demonstrative grieving followed the death of every Scythian tribesman. At the death of a king all Scythian tribes joined a show of stupendous grief that last Solokha days. Men of the dominant tribe, the Royal Scythians, cropped their hair, lacerated their ears, forehead, noses and arms. After the king was buried with the best of all his weapons and possessions, the funeral party strangled one of his concubines, his cupbearer, his cook, his lackey, his messenger and his best horses and place all the bodies by him. Then the grave was to be covered with 60-feet hight mound.[PARAGRAPH:2]Even then, the funeral was not over. One year later as many as Tanais Scythian youths might be selected from among those who had directly served the king. They would be strangled and buried in a circle around the royal tomb.[PARAGRAPH:2]One thing that Herodotus failed to report about these Scythian warriors is that they produced art of stunning force and vitality. Around the 6th century BC, the Scythian created an art of pattern and ornament with naturalistic motifs based on animals. The favorite animals of the Scythian style are the stag, the horse, the ibex, the boar, the bear, the wolf, the felines, the eagle and the fish. The Scythian animal art style was adopted by all the mounted nomads as far as the borders of China by the end of the first millennium BC. During last two centuries, many rich and extraordinary finds were excavated from Scythian tombs and graves such as Pazyryk site in the Altai mountain of south-central Siberia, Kul Oba in the Kuban basin of the northern Black Sea.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_SELEUKIA_PEDIA">[TAB]After the death of Alexander the Great in the afternoon of 11 June 323 BCE, his empire was divided by his generals, the Diadochi. One of them was his friend Seleucus, who became king of the eastern provinces - more or less modern Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, together with parts of Turkey, Armenia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. His kingdom had two capitals, which he founded in c.300: Antioch in Syria (pictures) and Seleucia in Mesopotamia. Babylon was another important city. The empire was, like the empire of Alexander, actually the continuation of the empires before: the Assyrian, Babylonian, and the Achaemenid Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]Seleucus' reign lasted from 312 to 281 (more...), and he was succeeded by his descendants, who continued to govern this assembly of countries for more than two centuries. However, in the mid-240's, during a brief interregnum, the Seleucids started to lose territory in the east, where the Parni nomads settled themselves in the satrapy of Parthia in northeastern Iran. At the same time, the satrapy of Bactria (northern Afghanistan) became independent. Later, the Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great was able to reconquer these territories, during a series of eastern wars between 209 and 204. In the southwest, the Seleucid kings fought several \"Syrian wars\" with the Egyptians; in 200, their king was forced to cede Palestine to Antiochus III. Seleucid power had reached its zenith. Yet, Antiochus was also forced to witness the beginning of its demise.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 196, he crossed the Hellespont in order to add Thrace to his empire (which happened in 194). Seleucid influence in Europe, however, was something that the Romans could not allow to happen, and the inevitable war between the two superpowers broke out in 192. (One of our sources, the Syriaca by the Greek historian Appian of Alexandria, can be read here.) Antiochus received support from many Greek towns and help from the famous Carthaginian general Hannibal, but was defeated and forced to pay a tremendous sum of money. Moreover, the Seleucid empire lost its possessions in what is now Turkey.[PARAGRAPH:2]The tide was now turning against the Seleucid monarchy. In the west, Rome became too powerful to resist. Worse, they backed the Jews, who liberated themselves in the years after 165 (the Maccabaean revolt). At the same time, the Parni founded the Parthian empire, which snatched away the eastern provinces. The towns in Babylonia, a.o. Seleucia and Babylon, were captured between April and June 141. New losses followed, civil wars between two rival factions of the Seleucid family were inevitable, and in the second quarter of the first century, the Roman generals Lucullus and Pompey the Great made an end to the Seleucid kingdom. The last king was dethroned in 64.[PARAGRAPH:2]The official name of the kingdom was Asia, but the Romans called it Syria.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_SELJUK_PEDIA">[TAB]The Seljuk Turks (also Seldjuk, Seluk, Seljuk Turks)  ruled a huge Persianized empire in the eleventh century, which was a practical successor to the northern part of the Arab empire, as it included Baghdad and all of Persia. At its largest extent, which lasted for only a brief time, it also included all of Palestine and Anatolia in the West, and a large part of Afghanistan in the East, and reached as far north as the Aral sea and Armenia. The Seljuks were originally a clan or clans of the Oguz or Oghuz Turkmen tribes that invaded the Central Asian Steppes about 1000 CE.  They converted to Islam, and, on conquering Persia, became Persianized in language and culture. The rapid Seljuk expansion alarmed Christian Europe, which became concerned for the fate of the Eastern Roman Empire (\"Byzantium\" with its capital at Constantinople).  It also attracted the attentions of all the rival Muslim emirates and dynasties on their borders, and particularly the Shi'a, whose faithful were a majority in the area of Iran.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Seljuks came to speak Persian and spread Persian culture throughout the Middle East.  and they used Farsi as their official language. As with many of the Muslim empires, divisions were fostered by unclear rules of succession and by splitting up the emirates among the sons of rulers. Nominally, all the associated realms were ruled by a Grand Sultan, but the connections were weak and the they were slow to aid each other in case of attack. The Seljuk empire contracted until it was left only with Eastern Anatolia, called the \"The Seljuks of Rum.\" Rum is the Arab word for \"Rome,\" meaning the Byzantine empire. This area was populated by Byzantine Christians, Armenians and Sunni and Shia Muslims. The Seljuks succeeded in providing a relatively stable and tolerant state.  The Seljuk empire was subjugated by the Mongols and eventually eliminated.[PARAGRAPH:2]About 1040 Togrul Beg, chief of the Seljuks and grandson of Seljuk, began to conquer large parts of the lands that comprises modern Iran and Iraq. By 1055, he had  conquered Baghdad from the Shia Buyids, and made himself protector of the caliph in Baghdad. Nominally, the Caliph was his superior, and bestowed the title of Sultan on him. Togrul's successor, Alp Arslan, expanded significantly upon Togrul's holdings by adding Armenia and Georgia in 1064 and invading the Byzantine Empire in 1068, from which he annexed almost all of Anatolia; Arslan's decisive victory at the Battle of Manzikert (in 1071) effectively neutralized the Byzantine threat, and, according to some historians, the Byzantines' defeat began their long decline. Alp Arslan authorized his Turcoman generals to carve their own principalities out of formerly Byzantine Anatolia, as atabegs loyal to him. Within two years the Turcomans had established control as far as the Aegean Sea under numerous \"beghliks\" (modern Turkish beyliks): the Saltuklus in Northeastern Anatolia, Mengujeqs in Eastern Anatolia, Artuqids in Southeastern Anatolia, Danishmendis in Central Anatolia, Rum Seljuks (Beghlik of Suleyman, which later moved to Central Anatolia) in Western Anatolia and the Beghlik of Caka Beg in Izmir (Smyrna).[PARAGRAPH:2]A crucial stage in Seljuk history and in the history of Muslim-Christian relations was marked by the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Battle of Manzikert  was fought between the Byzantine Empire lead by Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes  and Seljuk forces led by Alp Arslan on August 26, 1071 near Manzikert (Malazgirt). The power of the Byzantine empire had been waning. This battle demonstrated its weakness. The Emperor was captured and humiliated, but set free. The following year, Arslan died and the Turks proceeded to settle Anatolia, capturing Iconium (Konya) and making it the seat of their Rum sultanate. News of the Battle of Manzikert ignited the first Crusade. [PARAGRAPH:2]Toward the end of the Eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, the Seljuk state in Persia began disintegrating  into smaller states, ruled by relatives and descendants of the previous sultans. Western Persia (Hamadan) came to be ruled by a different line than southern Persia, Kerman, though for a time the Sultanate of Rum remained nominally under their sway. In 1097, the Seljuks were defeated by the Crusaders in Anatolia, losing Western Anatolia  to Christian rulers. In 1194, Togrul III, the last Iranian Seljuk sultan, fell  on the battlefield fighting Khwarazmshah, who annexed Western Persia. [PARAGRAPH:2]Around 1230 the Seljuks of Rum fought the Khorezmians and defeated them. However, they were invaded and subjugated by the Mongols in 1243. Seljuk rulers continued to rule as tributaries of the Mongols. Ghiyath ad-Din Mesud II, the last Seljuk Sultan, was removed and reinstated in office several times by his Mongol overlords. He died or was removed from office for the last time about 1306 or 1307, ending the Seljuk line.[PARAGRAPH:2][PARAGRAPH:2]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_SERBIA_PEDIA">[TAB]The ancestors of the Serbs settled in the region during the 600s AD.  During these early years of settlement, the Serbs came under a strong influence of the Byzantine Empire.  In the late 1100s, Stephen Nemanja founded the first sovereign, unified Serbian state.  Serbia arrived at its zenith in the 1300s, under King Stefan Dusan.  But in 1389 the Ottoman Turks defeated a coalition led by Serbia at the historic Battle of Kosovo, starting the period of Ottoman rule that was to remain for the next 500 years. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Rebellions against the Ottomans began in 1804 and lasted until Serbia won its independence in 1878.  The country began to gather all Serbian lands and peoples into a unified state.  Thus, Austria's takeover, in 1908, of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with its high density of Serbs, incited a time of bitter antagonism in Serbia. [PARAGRAPH: 1] When the war ended in 1918, Serbia led the movement to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes under the Serbian royal dynasty.  The country was renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929.  Serbian efforts to control the area aroused the hostility of other nationalities, especially the Croats.  After Yugoslavia was inhabited by Nazi Germany in 1941, during World War II, it became a battlefield between the two challenging guerrilla groups, the Serbian Chetniks and the Communist-led Partisans.  At the conclusion of the war in 1945, Serbia became one of the republics of the new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, organized by the Communist leader Josip Broz Tito. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Tito's firm authority over the country kept the old ethnic competitions and hatreds in check, but after his death in 1980, the intricate government organization began to crumble.  Serbian leaders were determined to convert the federation into a national state under Serbian control.  Other republics preferred a looser confederation.  Serbia responded to their secession with the use of federal military forces.  The resulting civil war cost thousands of lives and great destruction of property in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.  In 1992, Serbia proclaimed itself and Montenegro to be the successor to the Yugoslav state, as the Federated Republic of Yugoslavia.  After Montenegro left the federation in 2006, Serbia formed the Republic of Serbia as the official successor of the union of Serbia and Montenegro.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_SOMALIA_PEDIA">[TAB]As early as the seventh century, indigenous Cushitic peoples began to mingle with Arab and Persian traders who had settled along the coast. Interaction over the centuries led to the emergence of a Somali culture bound by common traditions, a single language, and the Islamic faith.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sizable ethnic groups in the country include Bantu agricultural workers, several thousand Arabs and some hundreds of Indians and Pakistanis. Apart from the Brava people who speak a language similar to Swahili, nearly all inhabitants speak the Somali language. A population of Italian descent, which dated back to Somalia's colonial era, began to emigrate following independence and by the outbreak of war most Italian Somalis had left the country. The language remained unwritten until October 1973, when the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) proclaimed it the nation's official language and decreed an orthography using Latin letters. Somali is now the language of instruction in schools, which are few. Arabic, English, and Italian also are used extensively.[PARAGRAPH:2]The independence of Somaliland from Britain was proclaimed on June 26, 1960, and on July 1, 1960, unification of the British and ex-Italian Somali protectorates took place. The government formed with Abdullahi Isse, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar was appointed President and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister. Later, during 1967, Mohammed Ibrahim Egal became Prime Minister in Aden Abdullahi Osman (nicknamed Aden Adde)'s government. Egal was later chosen as President of a self-declared Somaliland. He died in a hospital in Pretoria on May 3, 2002.[PARAGRAPH:2]In late 1969, a military government assumed power following the assassination of Shermarke, who had been chosen, and served as, President from 1967-1969. Mohamed Siad Barre, a General in the armed forces who was an ally of and helped protect Aden Abullahi Osman's government, became the President in 1969 following a coup d'etat. The revolutionary army leaders, headed by Barre, established large-scale public works programmes. They also successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign, in which they helped to dramatically increase the literacy rate from a mere 5% to 55% by the mid-1980s. Intermittent civil war has been a fact of life in Somalia since 1977. In 1991, insurgent forces led by Mohammed Farah Aidid, leader of the United Somali Congress (USC), ousted Siad Barre's government. The same year, the northern portion of the country declared its independence as Somaliland; although de facto independent and relatively stable compared to the tumultuous south, it has not been recognized by any foreign government.[PARAGRAPH:2]Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily in the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions. The UN withdrew in Operation United Shield by March 3, 1995, having suffered significant casualties, and order has not yet been restored. Yet another secession from Somalia took place in the northeastern region. The self-proclaimed state took the name Puntland after declaring \"temporary\" independence in 1998, with the intention that it would participate in any Somali reconciliation to form a new central government. A third secession occurred in 1998 with the declaration of the state of Jubaland. The territory of Jubaland is now encompassed by the state of Southwestern Somalia and its status is unclear. A fourth self-proclaimed entity led by the Rahanweyn Resistance Army (RRA), was set up in 1999, along the lines of the heat or desert Puntland. This \"temporary\" secession was reasserted in 2002, leading to de facto autonomy of Southwestern Somalia. The RRA had originally set up an autonomous administration over the Bay and Bakool regions of south and central Somalia in 1999.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_SOUTH_AFRICA_PEDIA">[TAB]South Africa has experienced a significantly different history from other nations in Africa as a result of two facts. Firstly, immigration from Europe reached levels not experienced in other African communities. Secondly, the strategic importance of the Cape Sea Route. The closure of the Suez Canal during the Six Day War exemplifies its significance. Mineral wealth also made the country extremely important to Western interests, particularly throughout the late nineteenth century; then, with international competition and rivalry during the Cold War. As a result of immigration, South Africa is a very ethnically diverse nation. It has the largest population of people from a mixed ethnic background, whites, and Indian communities in Africa. Black South Africans account for slightly more than 70% of the population.[PARAGRAPH:2]Racial strife between the white minority and the black majority has played a large part in the country's history and politics, culminating in apartheid, which was instituted in 1948 by the National Party (although segregation existed prior to that date). The laws that defined apartheid began to be repealed or abolished by the National Party in 1990 after a long and sometimes violent struggle (including economic sanctions from the international community) by the Black majority as well as many White, Coloured, and Indian South Africans.Two philosophies originated in South Africa: ubuntu (the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity); and Gandhi's notion of \"passive resistance\" (satyagraha), developed while he lived in South Africa.[PARAGRAPH:2]South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in Africa. Extensive fossil remains at the Sterkfontein, Kromdraai and Makapansgat caves suggest that various australopithecines existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. These were succeeded by various species of Homo, including Homo habilis, Homo erectus and modern man, Homo sapiens. Bantu-speaking peoples, iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen, moved south of the Limpopo River into modern-day South Africa by the fourth or fifth century (the Bantu expansion) displacing the original Khoi and San speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the Xhosa people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoi and San people, reaching the Fish River, in today's Eastern Cape Province. These Iron Age populations displaced earlier hunter-gatherer peoples as they migrated.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1948, the National Party was elected to power, and began implementing a series of harsh segregationist laws that would become known collectively as apartheid. Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialisation of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of Africa, often comparable to \"First World\" western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. However, the average income and life expectancy of a black, 'Indian' or 'coloured' South African compared favourably to many other African states, such as Ghana and Tanzania.[PARAGRAPH:2]Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread sanctions and divestment abroad and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also the article on the History of South Africa in the apartheid era.) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and at times violent resistance, strikes, marches, protests, and sabotage, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the African National Congress (ANC), followed. In 1990, the National Party government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the African National Congress and other left-wing political organisations, and released Nelson Mandela from prison after twenty-seven years' incarceration on a sabotage sentence. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and the first multi-racial elections were held in 1994. The ANC won by an overwhelming majority and has been in power ever since.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_SWEDEN_PEDIA">[TAB]Little is known of Swedish history before the Viking period of the late 8th century.  Two related peoples, the Svear and the Götar, then lived in south central Sweden.  Almost incessantly at war with each other, they united in the 9th century under the control of Svear.  The Swedish name for Sweden, Sverige, means \"realm of the Svear.\"  Swedish Vikings sailed eastward across the Baltic Sea and into the rivers of Russia.   By the 9th and 10th centuries they were doing business as far east as Constantinople.  According to legend, a Swedish Viking chieftain, Rurik, was the creator of the first Russian monarchy.  Finland came under Swedish rule in the 12th century.  In 1397 the Union of Kalmar joined the kingdoms of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway under the Danish monarchy.  The Swedes opposed Danish command, which ended in 1523, when Gustavus Vasa came to the Swedish throne as King Gustav I. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Under Gustav I and his successors, Sweden became a martial power.  Two Swedish monarchs were famed as warrior kings.  Gustav II, also known as Gustavus Adolphus, won great triumphs in the Thirty Years' War.  As an effect of this war, Sweden increased land in northern Germany and became master of the Baltic region.  In 1638, Sweden founded a brief colony in America called New Sweden.  Continually challenged by its neighbors, Sweden fought a series of wars with Denmark, Russia, Poland, and Saxony during the early 18th century.  The Swedish king Charles XII won first impressive victories.  But his devastating defeat by the Russian Tsar Peter the Great in 1709 commenced Sweden's decline as a European power. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The loss of Finland to Russia in 1809 led to the deposition of King Gustav IV.  A new constitution was adopted and a Frenchman, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, was chosen as the Swedish crown prince.  After Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Norway was taken from Denmark and given to Sweden to substitute its loss of Finland.  The union of Sweden and Norway lasted until 195,, when Norway peacefully gained its independence.  Bernadotte came to the throne in 1818 as King Charles XIV John and was the founder of the present Swedish royal house. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The constant years of war impoverished Sweden.  A lack of financial prospects caused a large number of Swedes to emigrate from the country.  Sweden was never again to go to war, adopting the policy of neutrality and nonalignment that continues today.  The growth of Swedish industry in the early 20th century restored its economy.  Sweden also developed its social welfare system that guaranteed the needs of existence to every Swedes.  Sweden was able to uphold its neutrality in both World War I and II, establishing itself as a haven for refugees escaping the damage of both these wars.  Sweden has also sought to promote peace in not only itself, but in all countries.  Many of Sweden's troops served in the United Nations peacekeeping forces.</string>

Songtsen Gampo was not a practicing Buddhist, but his queens, from Nepal and China, built the first Buddhist temple in Lhasa and furnished it with images.  However, Buddhism did not become firmly rooted until the following century, when King Trisong Detsen invited the Indian teacher Shantarakshita to establish Tibet's first Buddhist monastery, which he accomplished with the aid of the compelling Padmasambhava. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The Yarlung Empire fell apart in the ninth century.  Interest in Buddhism remained limited until the tenth century, when Tibetans traveled to India to study and translate sacred texts.  Indian masters also came to Tibet to spread the religion, the most celebrated being Atisha whose arrival in 1042 AD traditionally marks the \"Second Propagation\" of Buddhism into the country.  Atisha's followers founded the Kadam-pa religious order.  The order stressed the importance of applying the ideals of a bodhisattva in the practitioner's daily life. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Other orders born at this time included the Sakya-pa, which won powerful allies in the Mongol Empire, notably Kublai Khan.  The declining of Mongol influence in the middle of the fourteenth century weakened the Sakya-pa.  A new dynasty, the Pamotrupa, sought to revive the glory of the Yarlung kings, while the discovery of texts \"hidden\" by Padmasambhava gave fresh momentum to the Nyingma-pa order he had founded. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The most influential scholar and reformer of the time was Tsong Khapa.  His avocation of monastic discipline motivated his disciples to found the Gelug-pa religious order.  The Gelug-pa at first avoided direct involvement in secular matters, but their piety attracted Mongol attention.  In 1578 the Mongol leader Altan Khan gave a prominent Gelug-pa lama the title of Dalai Lama.  Half a century later, with Mongolian assistance, the Dalai Lama became Tibet's sacred and secular leader.  This theocratic system of government survived until 1959, when the communist Chinese drove the fourteenth Dalai Lama into exile.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_TIMURID_PEDIA">[TAB]The Timurids, self-designated Gurkani, were a Persianate Central Asian Sunni Muslim dynasty of originally Turko-Mongol descent whose empire included the whole of Central Asia, Iran, modern Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as large parts of India, Mesopotamia and Caucasus. It was founded by the legendary conqueror Timur (Tamerlane) in the 14th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 16th century, Timurid prince Babur, the ruler of Ferghana, invaded India and founded the Mughal Empire, who ruled most of the Indian subcontinent until its decline after Aurangzeb in the early 18th century, and its eventual demise by the British Raj after the Indian rebellion of 1857.[PARAGRAPH:2]The origin of the Timurid dynasty goes back to the Mongolian nomadic confederation known as Barlas, who were remnants of the original Mongol army of Genghis Khan. After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia, the Barlas settled in Turkistan (which then became also known as Moghulistan - \"Land of Mongols\") and intermingled to a considerable degree with the local Turkic and Turkic-speaking population, so that at the time of Timur's reign the Barlas had become thoroughly Turkicized in terms of language and habits. Additionally, by adopting Islam, the Central Asian Turks and Mongols also adopted the Persian literary and high culture which has dominated Central Asia since the early days of Islamic influence. Persian literature was instrumental in the assimilation of the Timurid elite to the Perso-Islamic courtly culture. Timur was also steeped in Persian culture[12] and in most of the territories which he incorporated, Persian was the primary language of administration and literary culture. Thus the language of the settled \"diwan\" was Persian, and its scribes had to be thoroughly adept in Persian culture, whatever their ethnic origin.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although the Timurids hailed from the Barlas tribe which was of Mongol origin, they had embraced Persian culture and Persian art (distinguished by extensive adaptations from the Chinese), and also Chagatay Literature, converted to Islam and resided in Turkestan and Khorasan. Thus, the Timurid era had a dual character, which reflected both the Turco-Mongol origins and the Persian culture as well the Persian language. The Persian language was also the state language (also known as Diwan language) of the dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the end of the Timurid Empire in 1506, the Mughal Empire was later established in India by Babur in 1526, who was a descendant of Timur through his father and possibly a descendant of Genghis Khan through his mother. The dynasty he established is commonly known as the Mughal Dynasty. By the 17th century, the Mughal Empire ruled most of India, but later declined during the 18th century. The Timurid Dynasty came to an end in 1857 after the Mughal Empire was dissolved by the British Empire and Bahadur Shah II was exiled to Burma.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_TOLTEC_PEDIA">[TAB]The Toltec Empire appeared in the Central Mexico area in the 10th century AD, when they established their central city of Tula. It is believed that the Toltecs were refugees from the northern Teotihuacán culture and migrated after its fall in 700 AD.[PARAGRAPH:2]Little is known directly about the Toltecs because the Aztecs plundered the Tula ruins for building materials for their nearby capital, destroying most of the historical evidence that remained. Much of what we know about the Toltecs comes from legends carried on about them by later cultures.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Toltec Empire was the first of the extreme militaristic cultures in the region that used their might to dominate their neighbors, a trend associated with the later cultures in the region, especially the Aztecs. Eventually the empire spread across most of Mexico, Guatemala, and as far south as the Yucatan, as they conquered lands previously controlled by the Mayans.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Toltec Empire and leaders created an unmatched mystique in the minds of the Central American people. The Toltec leaders were thought of as being alongside deities. Later cultures often revered them and copied their legends, art, buildings and religion. Many future rulers of other cultures, including Mayan leaders and Aztec emperors, claimed to be descended from the Toltecs.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Toltecs sported the familiar ball game played by many central American cultures and may have sacrificed the losers. Toltecs are known for their somewhat rougher form of architecture, a form that would later inspire the Aztec builders. Toltec art is characterized by walls covered with snakes and skulls, images of a reclining Chac-mool (red jaguar), and the colossal statues of the Atlantes, men carved from great columns.[PARAGRAPH:2]Religion in the Toltec Empire was dominated by two major deities. The first, Quetzalcoatl, is shown as a plumed serpent. This deity of learning, culture, philosophy, fertility, holiness and gentility was absorbed from earlier cultures in the area. His rival was Tezcatlipoca, the smoked mirror, known for his warlike nature and tyranny.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Toltec Empire lasted until the 12th century, when it was destroyed by the Chitimecs and other attacking groups. The Toltec people were absorbed by the conquerors and in the south they became assimilated with the Maya, subordinates to the people they once conquered.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_TROY_PEDIA">[TAB]Troy is a legendary city, center of the Trojan War, described in the Trojan War cycle, especially in the Iliad, one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer.[PARAGRAPH:2]The story of the Trojans first began in myth and legend. According to Greek mythology, the Trojans were the ancient citizens of the city of Troy in the Troad area, in the land of Asia Minor (or Little Asia, now Turkey). Although part of Asia, Troy is presented in the legend as part of the Greek culture of City states. Troy was known for its riches, gained from port trade with east and west, fancy clothes, iron production, and massive defensive walls. The Trojan royal family was started by Electra and Zeus, the parents of Dardanus. Dardanus, the legendary founder of Troy, crossed over to Asia Minor from the island of Samothrace, where he met Teucer. Teucer was himself also a coloniser from Attica, and treated Dardanus with respect. Eventually Dardanus married Teucer's daughters, and founded Dardania (later ruled by Aeneas). Upon Dardanus' death, the Kingdom was passed to his grandson Tros, who called the people Trojans and the land Troad, after himself. Ilus, son of Tros, founded the city of Ilium (Troy) that he called after himself. Zeus gave Ilus the Palladium. Poseidon and Apollo built the walls and fortifications around Troy for Laomedon, son of Ilus the younger. When Laomedon refused to pay, Poseidon flooded the land and demanded the sacrifice of Hesione to a sea monster. Pestilence came and the sea monster snatched away the people of the plain.[PARAGRAPH:2]One generation before the Trojan War, Heracles captured Troy and killed Laomedon and his sons, except for young Priam. Priam later became king. During his reign, the Mycenaean Greeks invaded and captured Troy in the Trojan War (1193-1183 BC). The Maxyans were a west Libyan tribe who said that they were descended from the men of Troy, according to Herodotus. The Trojan ships transformed into naiads, who rejoiced to see the wreckage of Odysseus' ship.[PARAGRAPH:2]Trojan rule in Asia Minor was replaced by the Herakleid dynasty in Sardis that ruled for 505 years until the time of Candaules. The Ionians, Cimmerians, Phrygians, Milesians of Sinope, and Lydians moved into Asia Minor. The Persians invaded in 546 BC.[PARAGRAPH:2]Some famous Trojans are: Dardanus (founder of Troy), Laomedon, Ganymede, Priam, Paris, Hector, Teucer, Aesacus, Oenone, Telamon, Tithonus, Antigone, Memnon, Corythus, Aeneas, Brutus, and Elymus. Kapys, Boukolion, Aisakos, and Paris were Trojan princes who had naias wives. Some of the Trojan allies were the Hittites and the Amazons. The Aisepid nymphs were the naiads of the Trojan River Aisepos. Pegsis was the naiad of the River Grenikos near Troy.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_TUPI_PEDIA">The Tupi people are one of the main ethnic groups of Brazilian indigenous people, together with the related Guarani. They first inhabited the Amazon rainforest, then spread southward and gradually occupied the Atlantic coast. From the sixteenth century onward the Tupis, like other natives from the region, were assimilated, enslaved or simply exterminated by Portuguese and Spanish settlers, nearly leading to their complete annihilation as a culture, with the exception of a few isolated communities. The remnants of these tribes are today confined to indigenous reservations or acculturated to some degree into the dominant society. In southeastern Brazil they are an important presence in the genetic pool, while constituting a considerable portion of the lower classes in the North, Northeast, and Center-West.[PARAGRAPH:2]Guaraní is the name for a group of culturally related indigenous peoples of South America, distinguished from the related Tupi by their use of the Guarani language. The traditional range of the Guaraní people is between the Uruguay River and lower Paraguay River in what is now Paraguay, the Corrientes and Entre Rios Provinces of Argentina, southern Brazil and parts of Uruguay. There are contemporary Guarani populations in these areas, though their demographic dominance of the region has been reduced by European colonisation and the commensurate rise of the mestizo. Nevertheless, the Guarani language is still widely spoken across traditional Guarani homelands, most notably in Paraguay where it is used amongst all classes and ethnic groups as a symbol of national distinctiveness, and is an official language.[PARAGRAPH:2]The history of the Guarani people prior to contact with European explorers is not well documented. They did not have a written language and their history relied on oral tradition, and as they were a somewhat nomadic and decentralized society there is little in the way of reliable history.[PARAGRAPH:2]Early villages often consisted of communal houses, of ten to fifteen families. Communities were united only by common interest and language, and tended to form tribal groups by dialect. It is estimated that they numbered at some 400,000 people when they were first encountered by Europeans. They were sedentary and agricultural, subsisting largely on manioc, maize, wild game, and honey. Equally little is known about early Guaraní society and beliefs. They practiced a form of animistic pantheism, much of which has survived in the form of numerous folklore and myths. Guarani mythology is still widespread in rural Paraguay. According to the Jesuit missionary Dobrizhoffer, they practiced cannibalism, perhaps as a funerary ritual, but later disposed of the dead in large jars placed inverted on the ground.[PARAGRAPH:2]When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, they found that wherever they went along the vast coast of this newly discovered land, most natives spoke similar languages. Jesuit missionaries took advantage of these similarities, systematizing common standards then named línguas gerais \"general languages\", which were spoken in that region until the 19th century. The best known and most widely spoken of these languages was Old Tupi, a modern descendent of which is still used today by Indians around the Rio Negro region, where it is known as Nheengatu, or the \"fine language\". However, the Tupi family comprises also other languages.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the neighbouring Spanish colonies, Guarani, another Tupian language closely related to Old Tupi, had a similar history, but managed to resist the spread of Spanish more successfully than Tupi resisted Portuguese.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_UKRAINE_PEDIA">[TAB] The first historical state on Ukrainian territory was the Kievan Rus.  The name \"Ukraine\" actually was a term that once referred to a border region in the 1100s.  In 988 or 989 AD, the conversion of the Kievan state to Christianity was begun under Prince Vladimir.  Domestic conflicts eventually led to the breakup of the Kievan Rus into a number of small principalities, most of which were conquered by the invading Mongols in the 1200s, including Kiev itself.  An independent state of Galicia and Volynia existed until the 1300s before being conquered by Poland and Lithuania.  With the union of Poland and Lithuania in 1569, almost all of the Ukrainian territories were absorbed into the Polish kingdom. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Religious conflict between Roman Catholic Poles and Orthodox Ukrainians and peasant resistance against serfdom brought a nationwide uprising against Polish rule.  It was lead by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, a Cossack hetman, or commander, who established a Ukrainian state along the Dnieper River.  A partly military society, the Cossacks were made up of runaway serfs and others seeking freedom in the border lands.  The Ukrainian state was to be brief.  Brought on by military and political needs, it entered into an alliance with the czar of Muscovy, the state from which the Russian Empire developed.  In 1667, Ukraine was split between Russia and Poland.  An eastern Ukrainian state, governed by a hetman and Rada, or Council, but controlled by Russia, existed until 1764, when its government was abolished.  When Poland itself was partitioned in the late 1700s, most of western Ukraine also fell under Russian rule.  The rest became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. [PARAGRAPH: 1] A Ukrainian nationalist movement was active in both empires, but under the Russian tsars, Ukrainian cultural activities were strictly prohibited.  Between 1876 and 1906 no books were allowed to be printed in Ukrainian, and the language was banned from schools.  Under Austrian rule, Ukrainians were able to develop their cultural and political life more fully.  In 1917, during World War I, the Russian Empire was defeated and Ukrainian leaders formed the Central Rada, which withheld rule from the Russian temporary government.  After the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government later that year, a struggle began between the Communists and nationalists for control of Ukraine.  On January 22, 1918, the Central Rada announced it was fully independent Ukraine.  With the help of German and Austrian troops, the communists were barred from Ukraine.  The Ukrainians in Austria faced much different problems with the breakup of the Austrian Empire. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In the former Russian Ukraine, civil war ensued as several governments struggled for power.  The Communists eventually reoccupied the region, establishing the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  In 1922, jointly with the Russian and other Soviet republics, it formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or Soviet Union.  During the 1930s, the policy of forced collectivization of agriculture was carried out by order of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.  Resistance by Ukrainian farmers was finally broken by elimination of their food, causing the death by starvation of millions of people.  In 1939, on the eve of World War II, as a result of a Soviet pact with Germany, Galicia and Bukovina were reattached to the Ukrainian republic.  During the war, Ukraine underwent extensive damage from both Nazi German and Soviet forces.  The Transcarpathian region was united with Ukraine in 1945 and Crimea in 1954. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The breakdown of the Soviet political and economic system, and the growing feelings of nationalism of its many peoples, eventually led to the defeat of the Soviet Union in 1991.  On August 24, 1991, a declaration of independence was adopted by the Ukrainian parliament.  It was approved by 90 percent of eligible voters in a referendum on December 1, 1991.  Ukraine is now a republic with a president, a legislature, and a prime minister and Council of Ministers. </string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_UYGHUR_PEDIA">[TAB]Historically the term \"Uygur\" (meaning \"united\" or \"allied\") was applied to a group of Turkic-speaking tribes that lived in the Altay Mountains. Along with the Gokturks (Kokturks) the Uyghurs were one of the largest and most enduring Turkic peoples living in Central Asia. Throughout the history of Central Asia, they left a lasting imprint on both the culture and tradition. Today in China, Uyghurs live primarily in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (also known by its controversial term Eastern Turkistan). There are also existing Uygur communities in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, and Turkey and a smaller one in Taoyuan County of Hunan province in South-central China. Uygur neighbourhoods can also be found in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai.[PARAGRAPH:2]The ancestors of the Uyghur were the nomadic Turkic Gaoche People and the Tocharian peoples of the Tarim Basin. Gaoche meaning 'High Cart' was a reference to the distinct high-wheeled, ox-drawn carts used to move yurts. The Gaoche were Altaic pastoralists who lived in the valleys south of Lake Baikal and around the Yenisei River(Yenisei = Ana Say, or \"Mother River\" in Turkic). They practiced some minor agriculture and were highly developed metalsmiths due to the abundance of easily available iron ore in the Yenisei. They became vassals of the Huns and manufactured their arms. After the Huns they were passed as vassals to the Rouran and Hepthalite States. In 450 CE the Gaoche planned a revolt against the Rouran that was defeated by the Türk (another Rouran vassal tribe). This incident marked the beginning of the historic Türk-Tiele animosity that plagued the Göktürk Khanate. When the Göktürk defeated the Rouran/Hepthalite state, they became the new masters of the Tura (Tiele) (the name \"Gaoche\" was replaced by \"Tiele\" in historic records around this time). The Tiele were a group of Turkic tribes, which also included groups such as Xueyantuo(Syr-Tardush), Basmil (Baximi), Oguz (Wuhu), and Yakut (Guligan) from the Lake Baikal Region.It was also at this time that the Uyghur tribe was first mentioned in Chinese records as a small tribe of 10,000 yurts in the South Baikal region.[PARAGRAPH:2]Properly called the On Uygur, Toquz-Oghuz Orkhon Khanate, the Uygur Empire stretched from the Caspian Sea to Manchuria and lasted from 745 to 840. It was administered from the imperial capital Ordu Baliq, the first city built in Mongolia. During the imperial phase 'Uygur' came to mean any citizen of the Uygur Empire, and not just a member of the Uygur tribe. After the Battle of Talas, although they could have conquered the Tang Empire, they chose instead to use an exploitative trade policy to drain off the wealth of China without actually destroying it. In return, they policed the borders and quelled internal rebellions. Large numbers of Sogdian refugees came to Ordu Baliq to escape the Islamic Jihad in their homeland. It was from them the Uyghur were converted from Buddhism to Manichaeanism. The Uyghurs thus inherited the legacy of Sogdian Culture. In 840 CE, following a famine and a civil war, the Uygur Empire was overrun by the Kirghiz, another Turkic people.

It was in fact the Soviet Union that proved a deterrent to the Uyghur independence movement throughout this period. In 1949 the Nationalist Chinese were defeated by the Chinese communists. After that, East Turkestan fell under Chinese rule.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_VENEZIA_PEDIA">[TAB]The city of Venice originated as a collection of lagoon communities banded together for mutual defence from the Lombards, Huns and other barbarians as the power of the Romans dwindled in northern Italy. Sometime in the first decades of the eighth century, the people of the lagoon elected their first leader Ursus, who was confirmed by Byzantium and given the titles of hypatus and dux. He was the first historical \"Doge\" of Venice. Tradition, however, first attested in the early 11th century, states that the Venetians first proclaimed one Anafestus Paulicius doge in 697, though this story dates to no earlier than the chronicle of John the Deacon. Whatever the case, the first doges had their power base in Heraclea.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the High Middle Ages, Venice became extremely wealthy through its control of trade between Europe and the Levant, and began to expand into the Adriatic Sea and beyond. In 1084, Domenico Selvo personally led a fleet against the Normans, but he was defeated and lost 9 great galleys, the largest and most heavily armed ships in the Venetian war fleet. Venice was involved in the Crusades almost from the very beginning; 200 Venetian ships assisted in capturing the coastal cities of Syria after the First Crusade, and in 1123 they were granted virtual autonomy in the Kingdom of Jerusalem through the Pactum Warmundi. In 1110, Ordelafo Faliero personally commanded a Venetian fleet of 100 ships to assist Baldwin I of Jerusalem in capturing the city of Sidon. In the 12th century, the Venetians also gained extensive trading privileges in the Byzantine Empire and their ships often provided the Empire with a navy. In 1182 there was an anti-Western riot in Constantinople, of which the Venetians were the main targets. Many in the Empire had become jealous of Venetian power and influence, and thus, when in 1182 the pretender Andronikos I Komnenos marched on Constantinople, Venetian property was seized and the owners imprisoned or banished, an act which humiliated, and angered the Republic. The Venetian fleet was crucial to the transportation of the Fourth Crusade, but when the crusaders could not pay for the ships, the cunning and manipulative Doge Enrico Dandolo quickly exploited the situation and offered transport to the crusaders if they were to capture the Christian Dalmatian city of Zadar (Italian: Zara), which had rebelled against the Venetian rule in 1183, placed itself under the dual protection of the Papacy and King Emeric of Hungary and had proven too well fortified to retake for Venice alone. Upon accomplishing this the crusade was again diverted to Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, another rival of Venice in revenge for the 1182 massacre of Venetian citizens living in Constantinople. The city was captured and sacked in 1204 in a daring sea attack; the sack has been described as one of the most profitable and disgraceful sacks of a city in history.  For the following six decades, the latins held sway in Constantinople, ruling it.  The Byzantine Empire, which until 1204 had resisted several attacks and kept the Islamic invaders out of Western Anatolia and the Balkans, was re-established in 1261 by Michael VIII Palaiologos but never recovered its previous power. The Venetians, who accompanied the crusader fleet, claimed much of the plunder, including the famous four bronze horses which were brought back to adorn Basillica San Marco. As a result of the subsequent partition of the Byzantine Empire, Venice gained a great deal of territory in the Aegean Sea (three-eighths of the Byzantine Empire), including the islands of Crete and Euboea. The Aegean islands came to form the Venetian Duchy of the Archipelago. In 1295, Pietro Gradenigo sent a fleet of 68 ships to attack a Genoese fleet at Alexandretta, then another fleet of 100 ships were sent to attack the Genoese in 1299. From 1350 to 1381, Venice fought an intermittent war with the Genoese. Initially defeated, they devastated the Genoese fleet at the Battle of Chioggia in 1380 and retained their prominent position in eastern Mediterranean affairs at the expense of Genoa's declining empire. [PARAGRAPH:1]In the early fifteenth century, the Venetians also began to expand in Italy, as well as along the Dalmatian coast from Istria to Albania, which was acquired from King Ladislas of Naples during the civil war in Hungary. Ladislas was about to lose the conflict and had decided to escape to Naples, but before doing so he agreed to sell his now practically forfeit rights on the Dalmatian cities for a meager sum of 100,000 Ducati. Venice exploited the situation and quickly installed nobility to govern the area, for example, Count Filippo Stipanov in Zadar. This move by the Venetians was a response to the threatening expansion of Giangaleazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. Control over the north-east main land routes was also a necessity for the safety of the trades. By 1410, Venice had a navy of 3,300 ships (manned by 36,000 men) and taken over most of Venetia, including such important cities as Verona, Vicenza and Padua. The situation in Dalmatia had been settled in 1408 by a truce with King Sigismund of Hungary but the difficulties of Hungary finally granted to the Republic the consolidation of its Adriatic dominions. At the expiration of the truce, Venice immediately invaded the Patriarchate of Aquileia, and subjected Traù, Spalato, Durazzo and other Dalmatian cities. In February 1489, the island of Cyprus, previously a crusader state (the Kingdom of Cyprus), was annexed to Venice. The Battle of Lepanto, on 7 October 1571, ensued when a galley fleet of the Holy League, a coalition of Spain (including their territories of Naples, Sicily and Sardinia), the Republic of Venice, the Papacy (under St. Pope Pius V), the Republic of Genoa, the Duchy of Savoy, the Knights Hospitaller and others, decisively defeated the main fleet of Ottoman war galleys.  The Venetian forces fought brilliantly and were the driving force behind the crucial victory that turned the tide against the Ottoman Empire for good.  The five-hour battle was fought at the northern edge of the Gulf of Patras, off western Greece, where the Ottoman forces sailing westwards from their naval station in Lepanto met the Holy League forces, which had come from Messina. [PARAGRAPH:1]In December 1714, the Turks declared war when the Peloponnese (the Morea) was \"without any of those supplies which are so desirable even in countries where aid is near at hand which are not liable to attack from the sea\". The Turks took the islands of Tinos and Aegina, crossed the isthmus and took Corinth. Daniele Dolfin, commander of the Venetian fleet, thought it better to save the fleet than risk it for the Morea. When he eventually arrived on the scene, Nauplia, Modon, Corone and Malvasia had fallen. Levkas in the Ionian islands, and the bases of Spinalonga and Suda on Crete which still remained in Venetian hands, were abandoned. The Turks finally landed on Corfù, but its defenders managed to throw them back. In the meantime, the Turks had suffered a grave defeat by the Austrians at Battle of Petrovaradin on 5 August 1716. Venetian naval efforts in the Aegean and the Dardanelles in 1717 and 1718, however, met with little success. With the Treaty of Passarowitz (21 July 1718), Austria made large territorial gains, but Venice lost the Morea, for which its small gains in Albania and Dalmatia were little compensation. This was the last war with the Ottoman Empire. By the year 1792, the once great Venetian merchant fleet had declined to a mere 309 merchantmen. [PARAGRAPH:1]By 1796, the Republic of Venice could no longer defend itself since its war fleet numbered only 4 galleys and 7 galliots. In spring 1796, Piedmont fell and the Austrians were beaten from Montenotte to Lodi. The army under Bonaparte crossed the frontiers of neutral Venice in pursuit of the enemy. By the end of the year the French troops were occupying the Venetian state up to the Adige. Vicenza, Cadore and Friuli were held by the Austrians. With the campaigns of the next year, Napoleon aimed for the Austrian possessions across the Alps. Napoleans forces moved into Venezia without firing a shot, and the city's 1,000 year empire collapsed as an independent entity.  In the preliminaries to the Peace of Leoben, the terms of which remained secret, the Austrians were to take the Venetian possessions as the price of peace (18 April 1797).</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_VENEZUELA_PEDIA">[TAB]Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Spanish: Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela), is a country on the northern coast of South America. The country comprises a continental mainland and numerous islands located off the Venezuelan coastline in the Caribbean Sea. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela possesses borders with Guyana to the east, Brazil to the south, and Colombia to the west. Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, St. Lucia, Barbados, Curacao, Bonaire, Aruba, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Leeward Antilles lie just north, off the Venezuelan coast. Falling within the tropics, Venezuela sits close to the equator, in the Northern Hemisphere.	A former Spanish colony, which has been an independent republic since 1821, Venezuela holds territorial disputes with Guyana, largely concerning the Essequibo area, and with Colombia concerning the Gulf of Venezuela. In 1895, after the dispute over the Guyana border flared up, it was submitted to a neutral commission, which in 1899 decided it mostly in Guyana's favour. Today, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is known widely for its petroleum industry, the environmental diversity of its territory, and its natural features. Venezuela is considered to be among the world's 17 most biodiverse countries.	Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital Caracas which is also the largest city. Other major cities include Maracaibo, Valencia, Maracay, Barquisimeto, Ciudad Guayana and the popular tourist city of Merida. Venezuela is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of protected habitats.		The name \"Venezuela\" is believed to have originated from the cartographer Amerigo Vespucci who, along with Alonso de Ojeda, led a 1499 naval expedition along the northwestern coast's Gulf of Venezuela. On reaching the Guajira Peninsula, the crew observed villages (palafitos) that the people had built over the water. This reminded Vespucci of the city of Venice (Italian: Venezia), so he named the region \"Venezuola\", meaning \"little Venice\" in Italian. In Spanish, the suffix -zuela is used as a diminutive term (e.g., plaza / plazuela, cazo / cazuela); thus, the term's original sense would have been that of a \"little Venice\". Martin Fernandez de Enciso, a member of the Vespucci and Ojeda's crew, states in his work Summa de Geografia that the indigenous population they found were called \"Veneciuela\", suggesting that the name \"Venezuela\" may have evolved from a native word. The Vespucci story, however, remains the most popular and accepted version of the origin of the country's name.		Human habitation of Venezuela is estimated to have commenced at least 15,000 years ago from which period leaf-shaped flake tools, together with chopping and plano-convex scraping implements, have been found exposed on the high riverine terraces of the Rio Pedregal in western Venezuela. Late Pleistocene hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern Venezuela known as \"El Jobo\"; according to radiocarbon dating, these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC. In the 16th century, when the Spanish colonization of Venezuela began, indigenous peoples such as the Mariches, themselves descendants of the Caribs, were systematically killed. Indian caciques (leaders) such as Guaicaipuro and Tamanaco attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but were ultimately subdued; Tamanaco himself, by order of Caracas' founder Diego de Losada, was also put to death.Venezuela was first colonized by Spain in 1522, when it hosted the Spanish Empire's first permanent South American settlement[citation needed] in what is now Cumaná. These portions of eastern Venezuela were incorporated into New Andalusia. Administered by the Audiencia of Santo Domingo since the early 16th century, most of Venezuela became part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an autonomous Captaincy General starting in 1776. After a series of unsuccessful uprisings, Venezuelaunder the leadership of Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan marshal involved in the French Revolutiondeclared independence on 5 July 1811. This began the Venezuelan War of Independence. However, a devastating earthquake that struck Caracas in 1812, together with the rebellion of the Venezuelan llaneros, helped bring down the first Venezuelan republic. A second Venezuelan republic, proclaimed on 7 August 1813, lasted several months before being crushed as well.Sovereignty was only attained after Simon Bolivar, aided by José Antonio Páez and Antonio José de Sucre, won the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821. Jose Prudencio Padilla and Rafael Urdaneta's victory in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo on 24 July 1823 helped seal Venezuelan independence. New Granada's congress gave Bolívar control of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded Gran Colombia. Sucre, who won many battles for Bolívar, went on to liberate Ecuador, and later become the second president of Bolivia. Venezuela remained part of Gran Colombia until 1830, when a rebellion led by Páez allowed the proclamation of a new Republic of Venezuela; Páez became its first president.Much of Venezuela's nineteenth century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule. During first half of the 20th century, caudillos (military strongmen) continued to dominate, though they generally allowed for mild social reforms and promoted economic growth. Following the death of Juan Vicente Gómez in 1935 and the demise of caudillismo (authoritarian rule), pro-democracy movements eventually forced the military to withdraw from direct involvement in national politics in 1958. Since that year, Venezuela has had a series of democratically elected governments. The discovery of massive oil deposits, totaling some 400 million barrels,[citation needed] during World War I prompted an economic boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, Venezuela's per capita GDP was Latin America's highest. After World War II the globalization and heavy immigration from Southern Europe (mainly from Spain, Italy, Portugal) and poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society.	The huge public spending and accumulation of internal and external debts by the government and private sector during the Petrodollar years of the 1970s and early 1980s, followed by the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s, crippled the Venezuelan economy. As the government devalued the currency in order to face its mounting local and non-local financial obligations, Venezuelans' real standard of living fell dramatically. A number of failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government and society at large, has led to rising poverty and crime and worsening social indicators and increasing political instability,[opinion needs balancing] resulting in two major coup attempts in 1992.	In the February 1992 coup, Hugo Chavez, a former paratrooper, attempted to overthrow the government of President Carlos Andres Perez as anger grew against the President's economic austerity measures. Chavez was unsuccessful and landed in jail. In November of that year, another unsuccessful coup attempt occurred, organized by other revolutionary groups in the Venezuelan Armed Forces and those that remained from Chavezs previous attempt. In 1998, Hugo Chavez (who led the first unsuccessful coup in 1992) was elected president as a reaction against the established political parties and the corruption and inequalities their policies created. He remains president today. Since coming to power, Chavez has attracted some controversy through his reforms of the Constitution, the implementation of his \"Bolivarian Revolution\", and in April 2002 (though now a democratically elected president) Chavez was temporarily ousted from power by right-wing elements in the army and the business sector.	The venezuelan president is elected by a vote with direct and universal suffrage, and functions as both head of state and head of government. The term of office is six years, and a president may be re-elected to a single consecutive term. The president appoints the vice-president and decides the size and composition of the cabinet and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can diminish these objections.	The unicameral Venezuelan parliament is the National Assembly or Asamblea Nacional. Its 167 deputies, of which three are reserved for indigenous people, serve five-year terms and may be re-elected for a maximum of two additional terms. They are elected by popular vote through a combination of party lists and single member constituencies. The highest judicial body is the Supreme Tribunal of Justice or Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, whose magistrates are elected by parliament for a single twelve-year term. The National Electoral Council (Consejo Nacional Electoral, or CNE) is in charge of electoral processes; it is formed by five main directors elected by the National Assembly.	</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_VIETNAM_PEDIA"> [TAB]The Vietnamese civilization has existed for thousands of years. Vietnamese legends hold that native people populated and civilized the land more than 4,000 years ago. Chinese historical records tell of an indigenous people that existed about 2,500 years ago. Some historians, both in Asia and in the West, hold that the various peoples of today's Vietnam were brought together by a Qin Dynasty-era general who was fed up with the despotic rule of the Qin Shi Huang (First emperor of China proper) and escaped to the \"southern Yue [Viet] mountains\" to set up his own kingdom. He and his soldiers conquered the land and established a civilized society modeled after ancient Chinese customs. This Chinese general adopted the native language (which sounded similar to southern Chinese dialects anyway) and married local women, who gave birth to sons that inherited the kingdom. Whether this is indeed historically true or not is still subject to debate.[PARAGRAPH:2]What is known for sure is that for most of the period from 207 BC to the early 10th century, it was under the rule of successive dynasties of China. Sporadic independence movements were attempted, but were quickly extinguished by the Chinese army. In 939, the Vietnamese defeated Chinese forces at the Bach Dang River and gained independence. They gained complete autonomy a century later. For most of its history, Vietnam has been strongly influenced by its much bigger northern neighbor, China. However, during the rule of the Tran Dynasty, it defeated three Mongol attempts of invasion by the Yuan Dynasty. Feudalism in Vietnam reached its zenith in the Le Dynasty 1400s, especially with the emperor Le Thanh Tong. Between the 13th and 17th centuries, the Vietnamese expanded southward in a process known as nam tien (southward expansion). They eventually conquered the kingdom of Champa and much of the Khmer empire. [PARAGRAPH:2]The independent period ended in the mid-19th century, when the country was colonized by France.  French rule continued until World War II, when Japan briefly occupied Vietnam and used the country as a base to launch attacks against the rest of Indochina and India. When the war ended, France attempted to re-establish control but failed, after they were defeated at Dien Bien Phu. There was overwhelming support for a unified country, however, the West, particularly the United States feared that the highly popular Ho Chi Minh would easily win any election.[PARAGRAPH:2]The US under the Kennedy administration began to send military advisors into Vietnam and things quickly escalated from there.  The Communist strongholds in the North were supported by China and the Soviet Union while the regime set up in the South was supported by the United States. The conflict quickly escalated into the Vietnam War; one of the most controversial wars in history.  All American troops were withdrawn by March 29, 1973. By April 30, 1975, North Vietnam had overtaken the puppet regime in South Vietnam and by 1976, Vietnam was finally unified the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. This is the government that currently exists today. </string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_WALES_PEDIA">[TAB]Wales was first inhabited by hunter gatherers, who migrated in search of food.  Metal tools first appeared in Wales at about 2500 B.C., followed by copper and bronze.  The earliest iron implement is the sword from Llyn Fawr, a lake in south Wales.  The people living in Wales began to build hill-forts.  Historians believe that many other cultures began to inhabit the area, including the Celts, and began to force the previous inhabitants out of Wales.[PARAGRAPH: 2]Up to and during the Roman occupation of England, Wales was not a single country, but the area was divided among several tribes, most prominently the Silures and the Ordovices.  The first attack on Welsh tribes was by Publius Ostorius Scapula at 48 A.D.  The resistance was lead by Caratacus, who was eventually defeated and handed over the Romans.   The Silures continued to attack the Romans using guerrilla warfare, Ostorius died still with the Silures unconquered, and the Silures won a victory against Second Augusta Legion.  There were no further Roman campaigns to extend into Wales until 61 A.D., to the island of Anglesey, but was stopped by the threat of Boudica.  The Silures were defeated, eventually, at about 78 A.D.  The Romans then occupied Wales, and built it in a Roman fashion.  Most of the Romans purpose in Wales was of military nature.  When the Romans left, the states of Wales were left to govern themselves.  There was considerable Irish colonization in Dyfed in south-west Wales.  The Romans withdrawal was most likely from barbarians tribes like the Angles and Saxons. Wales then became Christian, and the Age of Saints began.  After the Battle of Chester, the connection between Wales and England had ended. [PARAGRAPH: 2]Wales was then divided into separate kingdoms, the largest being Gwynedd and Powys.  Powys was the easternmost kingdom and was under the most English influence.  A single person to rule the whole country during this period of Wales was rare.  All sons received an equal piece of their fathers land, establishing territories.  The first to rule a large portion of Wales was Rhodri Mawr, and his land was divided between his two sons, who extended the land more.  Wales was currently under increasing attack by the Vikings between 900 and 1000.  Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was the next person to unite Wales, he was originally the ruler of Gwynedd, but by 1055 the ruler of all of Wales.[PARAGRAPH: 2]At the time of the Norman conquest in England, the prominent ruler in Wales was Bleddyn ab Cynfyn, who was king of Gwynedd and Powys.  The killing of Bleddyn ab Cynfyn lead to a civil war in Wales, and the Normans saw this to their advantage.  In 1081 Gruffydd ap Cynan, who had just won the throne of Gwynedd from Trahaearn ap Caradog at the Battle of Mynydd Carn was enticed to a meeting with the Earls of Chester and Shrewsbury and promptly seized and imprisoned, leading to the seizure of much of Gwynedd by the Normans.  In 1094, there was a Welsh revolt against the Norman rulers and Gruffyd ap was able to build a strong kingdom in Gwynedd.  Stephen of Blois and Empress Matilda were later able to extend the borders of the kingdom.  After the Powys ruler Madog ap Maredudd died, Powys was divided into two separate kingdoms.  Out of the struggle however came Wales strongest ruler, Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, or Llywelyn the Great.  War broke out in 1245, and the issue was still in the balance when Dafydd died suddenly at the royal home Garth Celyn, Aber Garth Celyn, Gwynedd without leaving an heir in early 1246. Llywelyn the Great's other son, Gruffudd had been killed trying to escape from the Tower of London in 1244. Gruffudd had left four sons, and a period of internal conflict between three of these ended in the rise to power of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also known as Llywelyn the Last Leader). The Treaty of Montgomery in 1267 gave Llywelyn control, directly or indirectly, over a large part of Wales. However, Llywelyn's ambition in uniting Wales under his leadership conflicted with Edward I of England's ambitions in Wales, and war followed in 1277. Llywelyn was obliged to seek terms, and the Treaty of Aberconwy greatly restricted his authority. War broke out again when Llywelyn's brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd attacked Hawarden Castle on Palm Sunday 1282. Llywelyn appears to have hesitated before joining the rising, but eventually supported his brother. On 11 December 1282, Llywelyn was lured into a meeting in Builth Wells Castle with the Mortimer Brothers, captured and executed. His brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd continued the resistance, but was no match for the expensively equipped English army. He was captured at Bera Mountain, in the uplands above Aber Garth Celyn in June 1283 and executed by hanging, drawing and quartering at Shrewsbury. Wales became England's first colony. [PARAGRAPH: 2]After the passing of the Statute of Rhuddlan, King Edward dominated Wales with his castles.  Wales then became a part of England, even though its people spoke a different language and culture.  There were a number of rebellions, even one with French assistance.  However, the English quickly retaliated by threatening Wales.  In 1400, Welsh noblemen by the name of Owain Glyndwr, lead a revolt against King Henry VI of England.  Owain for a short time controlled Wales after winning it from England.  Eventually, the Kings forces were able to regain control of Wales.  As a response to Glyndwr's rebellion, the English parliament passed the Penal Laws in 1402. These prohibited the Welsh from carrying arms, from holding office and from dwelling in fortified towns.  In the Wars of the Roses which began in 1455, both England and Wales used Welsh troops.  The Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542 were passed, annexing Wales to England in legal terms, abolishing the Welsh legal system, and banning the Welsh language from any official role or status, but it did for the first time define the England-Wales border and allowed members representing constituencies in Wales to be elected to the English Parliament. [PARAGRAPH: 2]Wales for the most part followed the Church of England and in 1588, William Morgan produced the first Welsh translation of the Bible.  Wales was Royalist in the Wars of the three Kingdoms in the early 17th Century.  Wales gave men to King Charles I of England.  Welsh education was at a low during this period.  In the 18th Century, a Welsh Church was established, today known as the Presbyterian Church of Wales.  Sunday schools now made up a major part of Welsh education.  During the Industrial Revolution, Wales saw establishment of ironworks and coal mines.  The 19th Century for Wales was mostly Industrialized.  The new industrialism brought a conflict between Welsh workers and English employers, and eventually caused the Rebecca Riots in south Wales.  Partly as a result of these disturbances, a government enquiry was carried out into the state of education in Wales.   In the early part of the century Wales still largely supported the Liberal Party, particularly when David Lloyd George became Prime Minister during the First World War. However the Labour party was steadily gaining ground, and in the years after the war replaced the Liberals as the dominant party in Wales, particularly in the industrial valleys of South Wales.  The period following the Second World War saw a decline in several of the traditional industries, in particular the coal industry.  Wales was officially de-annexed from England within the United Kingdom in 1955, with the term \"England\" being replaced with \"England and Wales\", and Cardiff was proclaimed as the capital of Wales. Nationalism only became a major issue during the second half of the twentieth century.  In 2006, the Wales Act regained Royal Assent that the Queen would have a new identity as Her Majesty in Right of Wales and would for the first time appoint Welsh Ministers and sign Welsh Orders in Council.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_WESTINDIES_PEDIA">The Caribbean is a region of the Americas consisting of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (most of which enclose the sea), and the surrounding coasts. The region is located southeast of Northern America, east of Central America, and to the north and west of South America.[PARAGRAPH:2]Situated largely on the Caribbean Plate, the area comprises more than 7,000 islands, islets, reefs, and cays. The West Indies consist of the Antilles, divided into the larger Greater Antilles which bound the sea on the north and the Lesser Antilles on the south and east (including the Leeward Antilles), and the Bahamas. Geopolitically, the West Indies are usually reckoned as a subregion of North America and are organised into 28 territories including sovereign states, overseas departments, and dependencies. At one time, there was a short-lived country called the Federation of the West Indies composed of ten English-speaking Caribbean territories.The Caribbean islands are an island chain 2,500 miles long and no more than 160 miles wide at any given point. They enclose the Caribbean Sea.[PARAGRAPH:2]The term British West Indies refers to territories in and around the Caribbean which were at one time colonised by the United Kingdom. Collectively these territories are also now known as the Anglophone Caribbean. Between 1958 and 1962 all of the island territories except the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda and the Bahamas were organised into the West Indies Federation. It was hoped that the Federation would become independent as a single nation, but it had limited powers, many practical problems and a lack of popular support, and was consequently dissolved. Most of the territories, including all the larger ones, are now independent as separate countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, while some of the smaller ones remain British dependencies. All the nations of the British West Indies, except Dominica and Trinidad and Tobago, are Commonwealth Realms.[PARAGRAPH:2]Most islands at some point were, or still are, colonies of European nations:Spanish West Indies:Cuba, Hispaniola (present-day Dominican Republic, and until 1609, Haiti), Puerto Rico, Jamaica (until 1655), the Cayman Islands, Trinidad (until 1797) and Bay Islands (until 1643) French West Indies:Anguilla (briefly), Antigua and Barbuda (briefly), Dominica, Dominican Republic (briefly), Grenada, Haiti, Montserrat (briefly), Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Eustatius (briefly), St Kitts (briefly), Tobago (briefly), Saint Croix, the current French overseas départements of Martinique and Guadeloupe (including Marie-Galante, La Désirade and Les Saintes), and the current French overseas collectivities of Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin.

The university consists of three main campuses in Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, a smaller campus in the Bahamas and Resident Tutors in other contributing territories.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_XIONGNU_PEDIA">[TAB]The Hun tribes, or as the Chinese called them, the Xiongnu stemmed basically from the Siberian branch of the Mongolian race. During the third and second centuries BCE they rose to great power and became a tribal confederation. During Emperor Mo-tun reign (208-175 BCE), the Xiongnu were at the zenith of their might and occupied a huge territory from Lake Baikal on the north to the Ordos plateau on the south and the Liao River on the east. By 55-34 BCE their political influence reached as far as the lower Volga and the Ureal foothills. This expansion westwards significantly increased the trade with the western world. The trade route was leading now from the west through the northern oasis of east Turkestan to the Xiongnus' headquarters in north Mongolia and southward to north China.[PARAGRAPH:2]The basis of the Xiongnus' economy was herding, mostly pastoral nomads who lived in felt-cobbled tents, using bow and arrow from horseback. By the first century BCE there were also large settled populations with well-developed agriculture of millet, barley and wheat. The production of crafts flourished as wll, iron and bronze was smelted in their workshops and fine tools, weaponry, household utensils, jewelry and ceramics were produced.[PARAGRAPH:2]Chinese sources inform us that the Xiongnu worshiped the sun, moon, heaven, earth, and to their ancestors. They had shamans or medicine men who had great influence over the tribesmen. The horse played a leading role in the herder's migration, hunting and war. In special ceremonies they sacrificed white horses and drank the blood. When a man died his widows were married either to a younger brother or a son. When a great chief died, concubines and retainers were often killed and buried with him. The Xiongnu apparently had no writing. It is believed that they spoke one of the Turkic languages. However, the question of language is far from being resolved.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the newly established Chinese Han dynasty (AD 206-220), China expanded its borders and the Xiongnu empire lost ground. Weakened by the loss of men and animals because of their constant battles, and the split by internal dissension, the tribes of the confederation began one by one to accept a position of vassalage under China. The northern Xiongnu moved from Outer Mongolia into what was than Dzaungaria, where they conquered a new but short lived empire. With the beheading of their leader by a Chinese army the group disappeared from history.[PARAGRAPH:2]The southern Xiongnu, who replaced their northern kindred in Outer Mongolia, remained at peace with China for some years. With the turn of the Christian Era these Xiongnu extended their power west into Dzungaria and reasserted their independence from China, although some tribes along the borderlands remained vassals of the Chinese and served as buffers against their independent kinsmen. In the first of this millenium the Hsien Pei, a Tungusic or Mongol people, appeared north of China and conquered Mongolia, forcing the independent Xiongnu into Dzungaria. A century later the Hsien Pei also gained control of Dzungaria. The Xiongnu who had remained on the borders of China lingered on in history until the fifth century. Those who were forced out of Dzungaria by the Hsien Pei disappeared from notice in A.D. 170.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_CIV_YEMEN_PEDIA">[TAB]Yemen was one of the oldest centres of civilization in the Near East. Between the 9th century BC and the 6th century AD, it was part of the Minaean, Sabaean, Himyarite, Qatabanian, Hadhramawtian, and Awsanian kingdoms, which controlled the lucrative spice trade. It was known to the Romans as \"Arabia Felix\" (\"Happy Arabia\") because of the riches its trade generated; Augustus Caesar attempted to annex it, but the expedition failed, but Persian kings were more successful and Yemen became a Persian province in 597/8 under a Persian satrap. In the 6th and early 7th centuries, Yemen was successively incorporated into the Ethiopian and Persian Sasanian empires. In the 7th century, Islamic caliphs began to exert control over the area. After this caliphate broke up, the former north Yemen came under control of Imams of various dynasties usually of the Zaidi sect, who established a theocratic political structure that survived until modern times.[PARAGRAPH:2]Egyptian Sunni caliphs occupied much of north Yemen throughout the 11th century. By the 16th century and again in the 19th century, north Yemen was part of the Ottoman Empire, and in some periods its Imams exerted control over south Yemen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Yemen is in Southwest Asia, in the south of Arabia, bordering the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea, west of Oman and south of Saudi Arabia. It is considered to be one of the fifteen states that comprise the Cradle of Humanity.Until recently its northern border was undefined because the Arabian Desert prevented any human habitation there.[PARAGRAPH:2]The geography and ruling Imams of north Yemen kept the country isolated from foreign influence before 1962. The country's relations with Saudi Arabia were defined by the Taif Agreement of 1934, which delineated the northernmost part of the border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for commercial and other intercourse. The Taif Agreement has been renewed periodically in 20-year increments, and its validity was reaffirmed in 1995. Relations with the British colonial authorities in Aden and the south were usually tense.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Soviet and Chinese Aid Missions established in 1958 and 1959 were the first important non-Muslim presence in north Yemen. Following the September 1962 revolution, the Yemen Arab Republic became closely allied with and heavily dependent upon Egypt. Saudi Arabia aided the royalists in their attempt to defeat the Republicans and did not recognize the Yemen Arab Republic until 1970. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia provided Yemen substantial budgetary and project support. At the same time, Saudi Arabia maintained direct contact with Yemeni tribes, which sometimes strained its official relations with the Yemeni Government. Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis found employment in Saudi Arabia during the late 1970s and 1980s.[PARAGRAPH:2]Unlike other people of the Arabian Peninsula who have historically been nomads or semi-nomads, Yemenis are almost entirely sedentary and live in small villages and towns scattered throughout the highlands and coastal regions. Yemenis are divided into two principal Islamic religious groups: the Shia Zaidi and Ismaili sects, found in the north and northwest, and the Shafa'i school of Sunni Muslims, found in the south and southeast. Yemenis are mainly of Semitic origin. Arabic is the official language, although English is increasingly understood in major cities. In the Mahra area (the extreme east), several non-Arabic languages are spoken. When the former states of north and south Yemen were established, most resident minority groups departed.[PARAGRAPH:2]There was once a sizeable Jewish minority in Yemen with a distinct culture. This community is reduced to a few hundred individuals. The country has one of the world's highest birth rates; the average Yemeni woman bears seven children. Although this is similar to the rate in Somalia to the south, it is roughly twice as high as that of Saudi Arabia and nearly three times as high as those in the more modernized Gulf Arab states.</string>
