Bora rings are circles of foot-hardened earth surrounded by raised embankments. They were generally constructed in pairs (although some sites have three), with a bigger circle about 22 metres in diameter and a smaller one of about 14 metres. The rings are joined by a sacred walkway. The rings were used in ceremonies, particularly for initiation. They are named for the belt worn by initiated tribesmen.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_ARMUARIE_PEDIA">[TAB]While not necessarily this is specific to Romania - it is more correct to say this was some kind of \"feudal privilege\" granted to \"free villages\" (or to the \"free peasant\" - razeshi or moshneni - communities). The \"serf villages\" (satele de iobagi in Romanian) didn't have the right to build mills, forges or to have their own forests. They had to \"buy\" this services/products from their \"master\" ( boier in Romanian ) or \"supervising\" monastery ( if this was the case ) - with money or, more likely, working a number of days the land of their landlords. Opposite to this - the \"free villages\" had the granted right ( usually from the king - voievod or domn in Romanian ) to posses a \"communal mills\", or forges, judge some minor delicts by elder, even to trade non-agricultural products and so on. Most of these villages was founded in border-regions and, for their status, need to send soldiers (armed by the village) in case of war.[NEWLINE]This was a successful \"social arrangement\" for more than 2 centuries (XIVth-XVIth) and provided enough partially-trained soldiers to defend with some good military victories against superior enemy forces (Turkish, Polish, Hungarians and so on). Unfortunately - starting with the beginning of XVIth century the two Romanians principates ruled by Romanian lords (Walachia and Moldavia) - became the stage of internal fighting between landlords in order to impose a \"friendly\" king. The land and revenues of \"free-villages\" was a good motivation for the greed of \"boier-s and their abuse. In less than a century most of \"free peasant\" was transformed to serfs and the remaining ones was forced to accept reduction of their \"feudal privileges\". Despite the fact that those measure reduced the army and capacity of defense - the fear of nobleman for possible peasant uprising lead to drastically reduction of pre-existent \"peasant militia\". Even so, especially in western part of Walachia, there remains \"traces\" of old organization until the end of XIXth century (those man formed the main part of Tudor Vladimirescu's revolutionary units in 1821).</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_ARSENAL_PEDIA">[TAB]The Venetian Arsenal (Italian: Arsenale di Venezia) is a shipyard and naval depot that played a leading role in Venetian empire-building. It was one of the most important areas of Venice, lying in the Castello sestiere.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Byzantine-style establishment may have existed as early as the eighth century, though the present structure is usually said to have been begun in 1104 during the reign of Ordelafo Faliero, although there is no evidence for such a precise date. It definitely existed by the early thirteenth century and is mentioned in Dante's Inferno. The name probably comes from Arabic Dar al Sinaa (\"Dockyard\") and the concept was clearly Islamic as much as Byzantine. [PARAGRAPH:1]Initially the state dockyard worked merely to maintain naval ships built privately, but in 1320 the Arsenal Nuovo was built, much larger than the original. It enabled all the state's navy and the larger merchant ships to be both constructed and maintained in one place. The Arsenal incidentally became an important centre for rope manufacture, while housing for the arsenal workers grew up outside its walls. [PARAGRAPH:1]Venice developed methods of mass-producing warships in the Arsenal, including the frame-first system to replace the Roman hull-first practice. The new system was much faster and required less wood. At the peak of its efficiency in the early sixteenth century, the Arsenal employed some 16,000 people who apparently were able to produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly-built galley with standardized parts on a production-line basis not seen again until the Industrial Revolution. [PARAGRAPH:1]The staff of the Arsenal also developed new firearms at an early date, beginning with bombards in the 1370s and numerous small arms against the Genoese a few years later. Improvements in handguns led to their muzzle velocity (and therefore their ability to penetrate armor) exceeding that of the crossbow. The Venetian condottieri leader, Bartolomeo Colleoni, is usually given credit as being the first to mount the Arsenal's new lighter-weight artillery on mobile carriages for field use. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Arsenal's main gate, the Porta Magna, was built in about 1460 and was the first Classical revival structure to be built in Venice. It was perhaps built by Antonio Gambello from a design by Jacopo Bellini. Two lions taken from Greece situated beside it were added in 1687. One of the lions, known as the Piraeus Lion, is notable for having been defaced with lengthy runic inscriptions carved in the eleventh century by Scandinavian mercenary soldiers. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Arsenal Novissimo was begun in 1473. It enabled the creation of a system similar to an assembly line, in which hulls were constructed in the newer areas of the Arsenal before being fitted out in the old Arsenal. In the late sixteenth century, the Arsenal's designers experimented with larger ships as platforms for heavy naval guns. The most impressive was the galleass, already used at Lepanto, and developed from the old merchanting \"great galley\". It was huge, with sails as well as oars, and was virtually a floating fortress, with guns mounted on wheeled carriages along the sides in the modern fashion. It was slow and unwieldy in battle, however, and few were ever built. The galleon, also developed at the Arsenal, was an armed sailing ship, a slimmer version of the merchant \"round ship\". It was useful in major naval battles, but not in the small bays and off the frequent lee shores of the Dalmatian coast. [PARAGRAPH:1]Significant parts of the Arsenal were destroyed under Napoleonic rule, and later rebuilt to enable the Arsenal's present use as a naval base. It is also used as a research centre, an exhibition venue during the Venice Biennale and is home to a historic boat preservation centre.</string>

Brochs are some of the most sophisticated examples of dry stone architecture ever created.  The origin of brochs is still a subject of research.  Originally, archaeologists believed that brochs were built by an influx of immigrants pushed northward first by the Belgic tribes in southeast England and later by the Roman invasion of England.  However, there was never doubt that brochs were a Scottish invention.  The distribution of brochs is centered on northern Scotland, but some can be found on the borders and on the west coast of Scotland.  [PARAGRAPH: 1] The original interpretation of brochs was that they were defensive structures, places of refuge for the community and their livestock.  Another theory is that they are castles where local landowners held sway over a subject population.  A more recent theory is that brochs were the stately homes of their time.

By 1835, Chile was exporting 12,700 tons of copper a year, much of it to the United States.  Copper accounted for fifty-five per cent of the country's economy by 1860.  Chile became highly dependent upon its copper exports. After the War of the Pacific (1879-83), the quantity of copper that Chile mined continued to skyrocket.  Although the demand for copper put Chile way ahead of other nations in the region, its increasing dependence on copper put it at the mercy of the world market.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_CHORTEN_PEDIA">[TAB]In early India, mounds of earth, brick, and stone were used to house holy Buddhist relics.  These structures became known as stupas.  Their housing of Buddhist relics lead to the stupas as being seen as a symbol of Buddha's final liberation known as nirvana.  As their use spread across Asia with Buddhism, stupas retained their basic function as relic holders.  In Tibet, where they are known as chortens, the form was employed not only for sacred burial monuments, but also for metal reliquaries that are kept on Buddhist temple altars.  Tibetan chortens are overcome by elaborate tiered finials, often decorated with streamers and flags. [PARAGRAPH: 1] As well as ornate reliquaries set with precious stones and grand temples, such as the Pango Chorten in Gyantse, chortens can take the form of simple wayside markers made from little more than piles of rocks on the circuit around Mount Kailas.

They offer weary pilgrims and other travelers the spiritual reassurance that, wherever they may find themselves, the Buddha is all around.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_CLOISTER_PEDIA">Monastacism grew greatly during the twelfth century, and its reflection in architecture can be found in cloisters.  Before the twelfth century, cloisters were rarely seen.  The earliest visible cloister in Lombardy is the clositer at S. Alberto di Pizzo Como.  Lombard cloisters commonly possessed features like single colonnettes, central doorways, and archivolts of an unmoulded order.  These features were replaced with features native to Provence.  Cloisters with coupled colonnettes had been built in Lombardy as early as 1100.  These clositers show characteristics of those of Provence, Languedoc, and Spain.  The Lombard cloister is perhaps best represented at S. Zeno of Verona, which was built between 1175 and 1200.  The first vaulted cloisters could be found at Vezzolano.  The cloisters here date from 1180 to 1189.  The vault and decorations of these cloisters commonly contained French influence.  This style of cloister was reproduced in the thirteenth century by the Goths at Chiaravelle.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_COLOMBIA_COFFEE_ESTATE_PEDIA">[TAB]Historical data indicates that the Jesuits brought coffee seeds to South America with them circa 1730 CE, but there are different versions of this. Tradition says that the coffee seeds were brought by a traveler from Guyana who passed through Venezuela before reaching Colombia. The oldest written testimony of the presence of coffee in Colombia is attributed to a Jesuit priest, José Gumilla. In his book The Orinoco Illustrated (1730), he registered the presence of coffee in the mission of Saint Teresa of Tabajé, near where the Meta river empties into the Orinoco. Further testimony comes from the archbishop-viceroy Caballero y Gongora (1787) who registered the presence of the crop in the north east of the country near Giron (Santander) and Muzo (Boyaca) in a report that he provided to the Spanish authorities.  The first coffee crops were planted in the eastern part of the country. In 1835 the first commercial production was registered with 2,560 green coffee bags that were exported from the port of Cucuta, near the border with Venezuela. A priest named Francisco Romero is attributed to have been very influential in the propagation of the crop in the northeast region of the country. After hearing the confession of the parishioners of the town of Salazar de la Palmas, he required as penance the cultivation of coffee. Coffee became established in the departments of Santander and North Santander, Cundinamarca, Antioquia, and the historic region of Caldas.  Despite these early developments, the consolidation of coffee as a Colombian export did not come about until the second half of the 19th century. The great expansion that the world economy underwent at that time allowed Colombian landowners to find attractive opportunities in international markets. Little by little, the United States became the most important consumer of coffee in the world, while Germany and France became the most important markets in Europe.  The then large Colombian landowners had already tried to exploit the new opportunities that the expansion of the international markets offered. Between 1850 and 1857 the country experienced a significant increase in tobacco and quinine exports, and thereafter leather and live cattle. These early efforts in the export of agricultural commodities turned out too fragile; they in fact were only reactionary attempts to find the greatest profitability from the high international prices of the time, rather than attempts to create a solid and diversified export platform. The production of these sectors went into period of decline when the respective bonanza of their international prices terminated, hence a true industrial consolidation was prevented.With the fall of international prices, that registered the transition from the 19th to the 20th century, the profitability of the large estates plummeted. As if this was not enough the Thousand Days War, which took place during the first years of the new century, also negatively influenced the important landowners, making it impossible for them to maintain their plantations in good conditions; this circumstance summed to the fact that these producers had incurred in large amounts of foreign debt in order to further develop their plantations, which finally ruined them. The coffee estates of Santander and North Santander entered into crisis and the estates of Cundinamarca and Antioquia stalled.  The crisis that affected the large estates brought with it one of the most significant changes of the Colombian coffee industry. Since 1875 the number of small coffee producers had begun to grow in Santander as well as in some regions of Antioquia and in the region referred to as Viejo or Old Caldas. In the first decades of the 20th century a new model to develop coffee exports based on the rural economy had already been consolidated, supported by internal migration and the colonization of new territories in the center and western regions of the country, principally in the departments of Antioquia, Caldas, Valle, and in the northern part of Tolima. Both the expansion of this new coffee model and the crisis that affected the large estates allowed the western regions of Colombia to take the lead in the development of the coffee industry in the country.  This transformation was very favorable for the owners of the small coffee estates that were entering the coffee market. The cultivation of coffee was a very attractive option for local farmers, as it offered the possibility of making permanent and intensive use of the land. Under this productive model of the traditional agriculture, based on the slash and burn method, the land remained unproductive for long periods of time. In contrast, coffee offered the possibility of having an intense agriculture, without major technical requirements and without sacrificing the cultivation of subsistence crops, thus generating the conditions for the expansion of a new coffee culture, dominated by small farms.  Although this new breed of coffee farmers demonstrated a significant capacity to grow at the margin of current international prices, Colombia did not have a relatively important dynamism in the global market of this product. As can be observed in the following graph, during the period between 1905 and 1935 the coffee industry in Colombia grew dynamically thanks to the vision and long term politics derived from the creation of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia in 1927.  The union of local farmers and small producers around the Federation has permitted them to confront logistical and commercial difficulties that would not have been possible individually. With time and through the research made at Cenicafé,  founded in 1938, and the Federation's agricultural Extension Service, improved cultivation systems. More efficient spatial patterns were developed that permitted the differentiation of the product and supported its quality. Currently the Land of Coffee in Colombia includes all of the mountain ranges and other mountainous regions of the country, and generates income for over 500,000 coffee farming families.</string>

In these cases, the gate and wall towers often reach up to considerable heights, and gates equipped with two towers on either side are much rarer. Apart from the purely military, defensive purpose, towers also played an important representative and artistic role in the conception of a fortified complex.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_ETRURIA_FANUM_PEDIA">[TAB]The Fanum Voltumnae, or shrine of Voltumna, was the chief sanctuary of the Etruscans (fanum means sacred place, a much broader notion than a single temple). Numerous sources refer to a league of the \"Twelve Peoples\" (lucumonies) of Etruria, formed for religious purposes but evidently having some political functions. The league of 12 city states met annually at the Fanum, located in a place chosen as omphalos (sacred navel), the geographical and spiritual centre of the whole Etruscan nation. Each spring the political and religious leaders from the cities would meet to discuss military campaigns, civic affairs and pray to their common gods. Chief amongst these was Voltumna (or Veltha), god of the underworld. Historians have been looking for the Fanum from at least the 15th century but, until now, the precise location of the shrine is still unknown, though it may have been in an area near modern Orvieto (believed by many to be the ancient Volsinii).[PARAGRAPH:1]Roman historian Titus Livius mentioned the Fanum Voltumnae five times in his works and indicated Volsinii as the place where the shrine was located. He describes the meetings that took place at the Fanum between Etruscan leaders. He refers in particular to a meeting in which two groups applied to assist the city of Veio in a war it was waging. The council's answer was no, because Veio had declared war without first notifying it. Livius also says that Roman merchants who travelled to a huge fair attached to the meeting acted as spies, reporting back on Etruscan affairs to authorities in the city state of Rome. He was alone in mentioning god Voltumna, whereas Marcus Terentius Varro indicated a god prince of Etruria. That the Fanum was somewhere in Central Italy in the area between Orvieto and Viterbo is probable enough, but as Titus Livius has given no clue to its locality, and as no inscriptions have thrown light on the subject, it can be but pure conjecture to assign to it this or that particular site.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_FINLAND_SAUNA_PEDIA">[TAB]Historical evidence and records indicate that the Finns built the first wooden saunas over 2000 years ago. The early Finnish sauna was dug into a hill or embankment. As tools and techniques advanced, they were later built above ground using wooden logs. Rocks were heated in a stone fireplace with a wood fire. The smoke from the fire filled the room as the air warmed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once the temperature reached desired levels, the smoke was allowed to clear and the bathers entered. The wood smoke aroma still lingered and was part of the cleansing ritual. This type of traditional smoke sauna was called a savusauna, which means smoke sauna in Finnish. The smell of smoke and wood is relaxing to most people, especially those who have never been to sauna before. As the home of the sauna, Finnish sauna culture is well established, and plays an ongoing role in the central social structure.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_FOLWARK_PEDIA">[TAB]Folwarks are giant Polish farms that were operated in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century into the 20th.  They were used to produce a surplus of food.  The first folwarks were created on church and monastery owned grounds, but were later adopted by nobility and rich peasants.  The creation of folwarks was boosted by a growing demand for grain and its high profit. Folwark-based grain export was an important part of the economy of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth.  [PARAGRAPH: 1] The fall of agriculture goods prices in the end of the 17th century marked the start of a crisis for the folwark related economy.  The noble's attempt to increase use of folwarks only hurt the economic crisis more.  Until the 18th century, folwarks remained the basis for Polish noble's economic and political power.  After the abolition of serfdom in Poland, folwarks used paid labor.  Folwarks were abolished by the People's Republic of Poland with the PKWN decree of 6 September 1944 about agricultural reform</string>

Georgians are renowned for their love of music, dance, theatre and cinema. In the 20th century there have been notable Georgian painters, ballet choreographers and poets. Georgian theatre has a long history; its oldest national form was the \"Sakhioba\" (extant from the 3rd century BC to the 17th century AD). The Georgian National Theatre was founded in 1791 in Tbilisi, by the writer, dramatist and diplomat Giorgi Avalishvili (1769-1850).

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_GETAI_PORT_PEDIA">[TAB]The more enterprising tribes amongst the Getai used the rivers strewn throughout their lands to establish great networks of trade. They were able to link the variety of settlements that were found on the rivers with one another. Since the Getai had no remarkable tradition of maritime trade, the rivers were a welcome alternative. Rivers were easier to navigate than the open seas, and were found closer to the familiar settings of the mountains and forests. Trade along the rivers provided an extra source of income, and as a result, both great and small cities alike were able achieve wealth by utilizing the circuitous paths of river merchants.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_GOTHS_PLUNDER_PEDIA">[TAB]After Alaric laid siege to Rome for a third time, the city was taken and Alaric's dream came true. In a grand procession he rode at the head of his army through the streets of the great capital.[PARAGRAPH:1]Then began the work of destruction. The Goths ran in crowds through the city, wrecked private houses and public buildings and seized everything of value they could find. Alaric gave orders that no injury should be done to the Christian churches, but other splendid buildings of the great city were stripped of the beautiful and costly articles that they contained, and all the gold and silver was carried away from the public treasury.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the midst of the pillage Alaric dressed himself in splendid robes and sat upon the throne of the emperor, with a golden crown upon his head.[PARAGRAPH:1]While Alaric was sitting on the throne thousands of Romans were compelled to kneel down on the ground before him and shout out his name as conqueror and emperor. Then the theaters and circuses were opened, and Roman athletes and gladiators had to give performances for the amusement of the conquerors. After six days of pillage and pleasure Alaric and his army marched through the gates, carrying with them the riches of Rome.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_GREAT_TEMPLE_PEDIA">[TAB]The Toltecs built many temples for many purposes throughout their empire. There is some dispute about the purposes of the temples in the early part of the empire or pre-military rule. But according to all sources they were religious in nature. In one legend about the feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl, the temples were sources of sacrifices of not humans, but fruit and snakes to the plumed serpent god, until a military coup that exiled the high priest Acatyl Topiltzin and forced him and the other followers of the Plumed Serpent from the city. But most historians believe that the temples were, like most meso-american civilizations, places of human sacrifice, but also symbols of the Toltec majesty as they spread their influence far and wide throughout their empire and surrouding lands. </string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_HARAPPAN_SEWER_PEDIA">[TAB] In the Indus Valley, cleanliness was obviously an important part of their society.  The ancient cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro of the Indus Valley Civilization constructed complex networks of brick-lined sewage drains from around 2600 BC.  These cities also had outdoor flush toilets connected to this network.  The urban areas of the Indus Valley also provided public and private baths, sewerage was disposed through underground drains build with precisely laid bricks.  Sophisticated water management systems drained the sewage into reservoirs.  Drains from houses were also connected to wider public drains.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_HUNG_VEGVAR_PEDIA">After the Turks conquered much of southern Hungary, a new defensive line inside the country was strongly needed. Out of castles, mansions, churches and monasteries a new defensive line was built with the efforts of the bondsmen of the surrounding area within a short time. A new system of castles was created, which began at the Adriatic Sea, ended at the lower Danube River and enclosed the area that was controlled by the Turks. The most important places were Kanizsa, Györ and Komárom, in the north Érsekújvár, Kassa, Szatmár and in the east Várad, Gyula, Lippa and Temesvár, these fortresses observed every Turkish movement. [PARAGRAPH:1]From the 1550s on, the Vienna council sent some military engineers to Hungary, that rebuilt the most important Végvárs to a modern standard. The most important functions of the Végvárs were to defend the borders, secure the roads and the river crossings, the prevention of the enemy troop supplies and the security of the people and their goods in the surrounding area. [PARAGRAPH:1]Towers were built from where the defenders could fire at the attacking enemies that wanted to climb the walls, whereas the defenders where protected from enemy bombardments. After 1556 the military council took control over the Végvárs, thus they were under a uniform and competent command. Furthermore, smart defenders invented new military equipment and in peaceful times the wine supply didn't only delight the castles crew.  [PARAGRAPH:2]</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_INDONESIA_SPICESTOCKS_PEDIA">[TAB]The Indonesian Archipelago, home of the Spice Islands, has been an important trade destination since ancient times, when early Chinese sailors began to find profit in the spice trade. Much of Indonesia's history has been influenced by the many foreign powers that have been drawn to the archipelago and by its wealth of natural resources. Spice Islands most commonly refers to the Maluku Islands (formerly the Moluccas), which lie on the equator, between Sulawesi (Celebes) and the New Guinea islands in what is now Indonesia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Until the late 18th century, the Moluccas were the only source of economically significant spices, including clove, nutmeg and mace. Archaeological and linguistic evidence places Spice Island traders within a trading circuit reaching as far as mainland India around 200 BC. Pliny, the Roman author, described cloves not long afterwards. Javanese and Chinese merchants were heavily involved in the spice trade, and spices reached Europe only after passing through many foreign hands, with the main western terminus of the trade at Alexandria in Egypt.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_ITALY_CARNIVAL_PEDIA">[TAB]Hundreds of years ago, the followers of the Catholic religion in Italy started the tradition of holding a wild costume festival right before the first day of Lent. Because Catholics are not supposed to eat meat during Lent, they called their festival, carnevale - which means \"to put away the meat\". As time passed, carnivals in Italy became quite famous; and in fact the practice spread to France, Spain, and all the Catholic countries in Europe. Then as the French, Spanish, and Portuguese began to take control of the Americas and other parts of the world, they brought with them their tradition of celebrating carnival.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_KANEMBORNU_OASIS_PEDIA">[TAB]Kanem-Bornu under Aluma was strong and wealthy. Government revenue came from tribute (or booty, if the recalcitrant people had to be conquered), sales of slaves, and duties on and participation in trans-Saharan trade. Unlike West Africa, the Chadian region did not have gold. Still, it was central to one of the most convenient trans-Saharan routes. Between Lake Chad and Fezzan lay a sequence of well-spaced wells and oases, and from Fezzan there were easy connections to North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea. Many products were sent north, including natron (sodium carbonate), cotton, kola nuts, ivory, ostrich feathers, perfume, wax, and hides, but the most important of all were slaves. Imports included salt, horses, silks, glass, muskets, and copper.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_KAZAKH_HORSE_FARM_PEDIA">[TAB]Because livestock was central to the Kazakhs' traditional lifestyle, most of their nomadic practices and customs relate in some way to livestock. Kazakhs have historically been very affectionate about horse-riding. Traditional curses and blessings invoked disease or fecundity among animals, and good manners required that a person ask first about the health of a man's livestock when greeting him and only afterward inquire about the human aspects of his life. Even today, many Kazakhs express interest in equestrianism and horse-racing. In the national cuisine, livestock meat can be cooked in a variety of ways and is usually served with a wide assortment of traditional bread products. Refreshments often include black tea and traditional milk-derived drinks such as ayran, shubat and kymyz. A traditional Kazakh dinner involves a multitude of appetisers on the table, followed by a soup and one or two main courses such as pilaf and beshbarmak. They also drink their national beverage, which consists of fermented mare's milk.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_KOTEL_PEDIA">The Kotel, or Western Wall, in Jerusalem is the holiest of Jewish sites.  It is so sacred, because it is the remnant of the Herodian wall that enclosed and supported the Second Temple.  It is also called the Wailing Wall because for centuries, Jews have gathered at the wall to mourn the loss of their temple. [PARAGRAPH:1] The Western Wall was built by King Herod in 20 BC during his expansion of the Temple.  The construction took 11 years.  In 70 AD, the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple.  All that remained of the Temple, was the wall.  During the Ottoman Period, the wall became the Jews chief place of travel, where they came to grieve the destruction of the temple. [PARAGRAPH:1] For centuries, the Western Wall was located in a narrow ally, and could hold only a few hundred worshipers.  But, in 1967, after the Six Day War, Israelis created the Western Wall Plaza, which can accommodate tens of thousands of worshippers.  Another improvement made to the wall, was that the wall was made six and a half feet higher by digging down and exposing two more of the stones from the retaining wall.  This area was covered by debris for centuries.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MAGHREB_BERBERPASTURE_PEDIA">[TAB]Although stereotyped in the West as nomads, most Berbers were in fact traditionally farmers, living in the mountains relatively close to the Mediterranean coast, or oasis dwellers; the Tuareg and Zenaga of the southern Sahara, however, were nomadic. Some groups, such as the Chaouis, practiced transhumance. Traditional transhumance is the seasonal movement of livestock, ascending to mountain pastures in summer and descending to relatively warm areas in the valleys or desert fringe in winter. Transhumance is based on the difference of climate between the mountains (where the herds stay during the summer) and the lowlands (where they remain the winter). Its importance to pastoralist societies cannot be overstated. Milk, butter and cheese - the products of transhumance - often form the basis of the local population's diet.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MALAGASY_SALEGYHALL_PEDIA">[TAB]Salegy is the best-known and most widely exported dance pop music of Madagascar. It began in northern coastal towns like Majunga, Nosy Be and Diego Suarez (Antsiranana). Salegy is driving, 12/8 music with clear affinities to mainland Afropop styles in places like Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It is characterized by gently rippling guitar work, organ or keyboards and sometimes accordion, and powerful vocal armonies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The style originated with Malagasy folk songs, often sung during moonlight feasts. But as in the birth sagas of so many 20th century roots pop styles, pioneering musicians also needed to get an education in foreign music. As international pop styles, and music technology seeped into this remote, local scene, salegy pop emerged, and was being widely recorded by the 1950s and 60s. It evolved to feature rich, harmonized vocals and chiming guitar lines locked, restless, animated 12/8 rhythms. There is also a calmer, more romantic genre of the music, known as malesa.</string>

The Poro has its special ritual and language, tattooing and symbols, but details are scarce, due to an oath of secrecy. It meets usually in the dry season, between the months of October and May. The rendezvous is in the bush, at an enclosure, separated into apartments by mats and roofed only by the overhanging trees, serving as a club-house. There are three grades, the first for chiefs and big men, the second for fetish-priests and the third for the crowd. The ceremonies of the Purrah are presided over by the Poro devil, a man in fetish dress, who addresses the meeting through a long tube of wood.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MAPUCHE_MOHEDAN_PEDIA">[TAB]Toqui (Mapudungun for axe or axe-bearer) is a title conferred by the Mapuche  (an indigenous Chilean people) to those who are chosen as their leaders during times of war. The toqui is chosen in an assembly or parliament (coyag), of the chiefs (loncos) of the various clans (Rehues) or confederation of clans (Aillarehues), allied during the war in question. The Toqui could command strict obedience of all the warriors and their loncos during the war, organize them in units and appoint leaders over them. This command would continue until toqui was killed, deposed in another parliament (as in the case of Lincoyan, for poor leadership), or upon completion of the war for which he was chosen.  Some of the more famous Toqui in the Arauco War with the Spanish introduced tactical innovations; for instance, Lautaro introduced infantry tactics to defeat horsemen. Lemucaguin was the first Toqui to use firearms and artillery in battle. Nongoniel was the first Toqui to use cavalry with the Mapuche army. Cadeguala was the first to successfully use Mapuche cavarly to defeat Spanish cavalry in battle. Anganamón was the first to mount his infantry to keep up with his fast moving cavalry. Lientur pioneered the tactic of numerous and rapid malóns into Spanish territory.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MARAE_PEDIA">[TAB]A marae is a sacred place which served for both religious and social purposes in pre-Christian Polynesian societies.  In all Polynesian languages, any variant of this word means \"cleared, free of weeds, trees, etc.\"  It generally consists of an area of cleared land roughly rectangular, bordered with stones or wooded posts.  In the Maori of New Zealand, the marae is still a vital part of everyday life.  However, in most other Polynesian societies, most marae were destroyed or abandoned with the arrival of Christianity.  Despite all this, marae were built and still considered as a holy place and nobody would build on it.  [PARAGRAPH: 1] In Maori society, the marae is a place where the culture can be celebrated.  Various intertribal ceremonies were also practiced in the marae.  In Maori usage, marae is technically the enclosed space in front of a meeting house.  However, it is usually used to describe the marae itself and the surrounded complex.  The meeting house is the setting for important meetings, sleepovers, and craft and cultural activities.  The wharakeai, dining hall, is sued primarily for communal meals.  Many of the words associated with marae in tropical Polynesia are kept in the Maori context.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MEGYPT_EXHIBITION_PEDIA">[TAB]Jean François Champollion and Ippolito Rosellini were some of the first Egyptologists of wide acclaim. The German Karl Richard Lepsius  was an early participant in the investigations of Egypt; mapping, excavating, and recording several sites. Champollion announced his general decipherment of the system of Egyptian hieroglyphics  for the first time, employing the Rosetta Stone as his primary aid. The Stone's decipherment was a very important development of Egyptology. With subsequently ever-increasing knowledge of Egyptian writing and language, the study of Ancient Egyptian  civilisation was able to proceed with greater academic rigour and with all the added impetus that comprehension of the written sources was able to engender. Egyptology became more professional via work of William Matthew Flinders Petrie, among others. Petrie introduced techniques of field preservation, recording, and excavating. Howard Carter's expedition brought much acclaim to the field of Egyptology.Around 1830, Rifa'a el-Tahtawi was one of the first main scholars of Egyptian Egyptology. He was inspired by the work of Muslim Egyptologists in medieval Egypt, though modern Egyptian Egyptology developed slowly compared to its Western scholars, primarily because of Islamic identity. Islamic and modern Egyptian civilization has been influenced by the pre-Islamic Egyptian culture with which Egyptology is concerned.In the Modern era, the Supreme Council for Antiquities control excavation permits for Egyptologists to conduct their work. The field can now use geophysical methods and other applications of modern sensing techniques to further Egyptology. The Egyptian languages (such as Hieratics and Coptic) and the Egyptian writing systems are still of importance in Egyptology.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MENARA_PEDIA">[TAB]The Cham Empire was a religious empire, and built many temples.  A common feature of these temples is that there are towers, or menaras, in these temples.  The most famous temples of the Cham are the temples at My Son.  Other temples with towers are Po Klaung, Po Nagar, and Pho Hai.  In the village of Khuong My in the Vietnamese province of Quang Nam stands a group of three Cham towers dating from the 10th century. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The Po Nagar towers once stood at the entrance to a river. The Po Nagar towers complex was built between the 7th and 12th century. The most beautiful towers were built in the year 813 and 817. Most were destroyed and only four towers are still standing. Each tower is a shrine to a different deity.  There are eight towers at Binh Dinh which are commonly used to study Champa.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MEXICO_CHARREADA_PEDIA">[TAB]A charreada is a Mexican-style rodeo that is different from other rodeos. The Mexican cowboy or cowgirl is known as a charro or charra. In an American rodeo the competitors race against the clock, so the emphasis is on speed in any given event. On the other hand, in a Mexican charreada the excellent style and skills of the rider or roper are emphasized, and only one event is timed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Charrería (a word encompassing all aspects of the art) came to Mexico from Salamanca, Spain, in the 16th century. Interesting is the fact that when the Spaniards first settled in Mexico they were under the orders of the ruler to raise horses, but not to allow the Mexicans to ride them. By 1528 the Spaniards had very large cattle-raising estates. They soon found it necessary to employ the Mexicans as vaqueros or herdsman, and the natives soon became excellent horsemen. Small landholders, known as rancheros or ranchers, were the first genuine charros and invented charreadas.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MINOA_ANAKTORA_PEDIA">[TAB]The Minoans are perhaps most known for their huge palaces (Anaktoras). While it was believed that all of these palaces were built in the Middle Minoan period around 2000 BC, it have later been proved that this is not the case and that the palace at Malia were built as early as the third millennium BC in the Early Minoan period. The three main old palaces were the ones at Malia, Knossos and Phaistos. These palaces had a number of functions, such as centers of government, administrative offices, shrines, workshops, and storage spaces. This have created a discussion if it really is right to call these buildings palaces, and the term court building have been suggested instead. However, the original term is probably too well entrenched to be replaced.[PARAGRAPH:1]Often the conventions of better-known, younger palaces have been used to reconstruct older ones, but this practice may be obscuring fundamental functional differences. Most older palaces had only one story and no representative facades. They were U-shaped, with a big central court, and generally were smaller than later palaces. Late palaces are characterised by multi-story buildings. The west facades had sandstone ashlar masonry. Knossos is the best-known example. See Knossos. Further building conventions could include storage magazines, a north-south orientation, a pillar room, a Minoan Hall system, a western court, and pier-and-door entrance ways. Palatial architecture in the First Palace Period is identified by its 'square within a square' style, whilst later, Second Palace Period constructions incorporated more internal divisions and corridors.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is a common architectural standard among the Middle Minoan 'palaces' that they are aligned with their surrounding topography. The MM palatial structure of Phaistos appears to align with Mount Ida, whilst Knossos is aligned with Juktas. These are oriented along a north-south axis. One suggested reason for this is the ritual significance of the mountain, where a number of Peak Sanctuaries have been excavated like Petsophas. The material record for these sites show clusters of clay figurines and evidence of animal sacrifice.[PARAGRAPH:1](Wikipedia: Minoan Civilization)</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MOCHE_HUACA_PEDIA">[TAB]In Quechua, a Native American language of South America, a huaca or wak'a is an object that represents something revered, typically a monument of some kind. The term huaca can refer to natural locations, such as immense rocks. Some huacas have been associated with veneration and ritual. Andean cultures believed every object has a physical presence and two camaquen (spirits), one to create it and another to animate it. They would invoke its spirits for the object to function.[PARAGRAPH:1] The term 'huaca' is often associated with pyramids and temples in Moche culture. Impressive ziggurats can be found in a number of Moche sites. </string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MUTAPA_ZIMBA_PEDIA">[TAB]The word \"Zimbabwe\" could be a short form for \"ziimba remabwe\" or \"ziimba rebwe\", a Shona term, which means \"the great or big house built of stone boulders\". In the Karanga dialect of the Shona language, \"imba\" means \"a house\" or \"a building\" and \"ziimba\", or \"zimba\", mean \"a huge/big building or house\". A second theory is that Zimbabwe is a contracted form of \"dzimba woye\" which means \"venerated houses\" in the Zezuru dialect of the Shona language. This term is usually reserved for chiefs' houses or graves.</string>

Styles of folk music are related to the multitudes of ethnic groups in the country, each with their own techniques, instruments, and songs. JuJu is a style of Nigerian popular music, derived from traditional Yoruba percussion. This music, unlike apala, sakara, and fuji, was not created by Muslim Yoruba, and is therefore secular. JuJu music is performed primarily by artists from the southwestern region of Nigeria, where the Yoruba are the most numerous ethnic group. In performance, audience members commonly shower JuJu musicians with paper money; this tradition is known as \"spraying.\"</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_NORWAY_FISHMARKET_PEDIA">[TAB]Beside oil, gas, and income from the merchant fleet, stockfish is Norway's longest sustained export commodity, and the socioeconomically most profitable export over the centuries.  Stockfish is unsalted fish, especially cod, dried by sun and wind on wooden racks on the foreshore called flakes, or in special drying houses. The drying of food  is the world's oldest known preservation method, and dried fish has a storage life of several years. The method is cheap and effective in suitable climates, the work can be done by the fisherman and family, and the resulting product is easily transported to market.  Cod is the most common fish used in stockfish production, while other whitefish, such as pollock, haddock, ling and tusk, are used to a lesser degree.  Over the centuries, several variants of stockfish have evolved, notably salt cod. Salting was not economically feasible before the 17th century, when cheap salt from southern Europe became available to the maritime nations of northern Europe.</string>

Once theorized to be ballplayers, it is now generally accepted that these heads are portraits of rulers. According to archaeologist David Grove, the unique elements in the headgear can also be recognized in headdresses of human figures on other Gulf Coast monuments, suggesting that these are personal or group symbols. The heads range in size from the Rancho La Cobata head, at 3.4 m high, to the pair at Tres Zapotes, at 1.47 m. It has been calculated that the largest heads weigh more than 20 tons.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_PAKISTAN_ISI_PEDIA">[TAB]The Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (more commonly known as Inter-Services Intelligence or simply by its initials ISI) is Pakistan's premier intelligence agency. It is the largest of the three intelligence agencies of Pakistan, the other being the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Military Intelligence (MI).  ISI was established as an independent intelligence agency in 1948 in order to strengthen the sharing of military intelligence between the three branches of Pakistan's armed forces in the aftermath of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, which had exposed weaknesses in intelligence gathering, sharing and coordination between the Pakistan Army, Air Force and Navy.  ISI's headquarters are situated in Islamabad. It is currently headed by Lieutenant General Ahmad Shuja Pasha, who took over as ISI's Director in September 2008.After independence in 1947, two new intelligence agencies were created in Pakistan: the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the Military Intelligence (MI). However, the weak performance of the MI in sharing intelligence between the Army, Navy and Air Force during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 led to the creation of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in 1948.  The ISI was structured to be manned by officers from the three main military services, and to specialize in the collection, analysis and assessment of external intelligence, either military or non-military.  The ISI was the brainchild of Australian-born British Army officer, Major General R. Cawthome, then Deputy Chief of Staff in the Pakistan Army.  Initially, the ISI had no role in the collection of internal intelligence, with the exception of the North-West Frontier Province and Azad Kashmir.  In the late 1950s, when Ayub Khan became the President of Pakistan, he expanded the role of ISI in monitoring opposition politicians, and sustaining military rule in Pakistan.  The ISI was reorganised in 1966 after intelligence failures in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, and expanded in 1969. Khan entrusted the ISI with the responsibility for the collection of internal political intelligence in East Pakistan. Later on, during the Baloch nationalist revolt in Balochistan in the mid-1970s, the ISI was tasked with performing a similar intelligence gathering operation.  The ISI lost its importance during the regime of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who was very critical of its role during the 1970 general elections, which triggered off the events leading to the partition of Pakistan and emergence of Bangladesh.  After General Zia ul-Haq seized power in July 1977, the ISI was expanded by making it responsible for the collection of intelligence about the Sindh-based Pakistan Communist Party and various political parties such as the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).  The Soviet-Afghan war of the 1980s saw the enhancement of the covert action capabilities of the ISI by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). A special Afghan Section was created under the command of colonel Mohammed Yousaf to oversee the coordination of the war. A number of officers from the ISI's Covert Action Division received training in the US and many covert action experts of the CIA were attached to the ISI to guide it in its operations against the Soviet troops by using the Afghan Mujahideen.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_PHOENICIA_DYE_FACILITY_PEDIA">[TAB]Tyrian purple, also known as royal purple or imperial purple, is a purple-red dye which was first produced by the ancient Phoenicians in the city of Tyre.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tyrian purple was expensive: the fourth-century BC historian Theopompus reported, \"Purple for dyes fetched its weight in silver at Colophon\" in Asia Minor.[PARAGRAPH:1]The dye substance occurs naturally, but must be harvested by humans. It consists of a fresh mucus secretion from the hypobranchial gland of a medium-sized predatory sea snail, commonly called the spiny dye-murex, a species in the family Muricidae, the murex or rock shells.[PARAGRAPH:1]In nature the snails use the secretion as part of their predatory behaviour, but the snail also secretes this substance when it is poked or physically attacked by humans. Therefore the dye can be collected either by \"milking\" the snails, which is more labor intensive but is a renewable resource, or by collecting and then crushing the snails completely, which is destructive.[PARAGRAPH:1]As well as Tyrian purple, the Phoenicians also made a purple-blue indigo dye, referred to as royal blue or hyacinth purple, which was made from a closely-related species of marine snail.[PARAGRAPH:1]The fast, non-fading dye was an item of luxury trade, prized by Romans, who used it to colour ceremonial robes. It is believed that the intensity of the purple hue improved, rather than faded, as the dyed cloth aged. Pliny the Elder described the dyeing process of two purples in his Natural History: ... the Tyrian hue ... is considered of the best quality when it has exactly the colour of clotted blood, and is of a blackish hue to the sight, but of a shining appearance when held up to the light; hence it is that we find Homer speaking of \"purple blood\".[PARAGRAPH:1]Archaeological data from Tyre indicate that the snails were collected in large vats and left to decompose. This produced a hideous stench that was actually mentioned by ancient authors. Not much is known about the subsequent steps, and the actual ancient method for mass-producing the two murex dyes has not yet been successfully reconstructed.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_PICTS_CRANNOG_PEDIA">[TAB]A crannog is the name given in Scotland and Ireland to an artificial island or natural island, used for a settlement. The name can also be used to refer to wooden platforms erected on shallow loch floors, although understandably few remains of this sort have been found.[PARAGRAPH:1]The choice of an island as a home is thought to have been for defence as well as the availability of food in the form of fish nearby. The crannog could be reached from the nearest shore by means of a causeway built up with stones, or else a wooden gangway built atop raised piles.[PARAGRAPH:1]The islet of Eilean Domhnuill, Loch Olabhat on North Uist may be the earliest crannóg, dated to 3200-2800 BC in the Neolithic period. Most crannógs were in use from the Iron Age through to the early Medieval period, at about the same time as the brochs, the wags, duns and the larger roundhouses.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_PILIAKALNIS_PEDIA">[TAB] Piliakalniai are hill forts in ancient and medieval Lithuania.  The first piliakalniai are dated to the 1st millennium BC.  Most forts were refortified in later centuries against the constant invasions of the Teutonic Knights.  Most of the forts were located on the banks of a river, or where two rivers met.  The hill was often sculpted for defense, with flattened tops and steeper slopes.  The fortifications also were typically wooden, though some had stone or brick walls.  During the early years of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, piliakalniai played a major role in battles against the Livonian Order and Teutonic Knights.  During that time, their construction decreased but they became stronger.  Their effectiveness decreased as firearms and cannons developed, and their numbers began to decline.</string>

From earliest recorded time, peyote has been used by indigenous peoples, such as the Huichol of northern Mexico and by various Native American Tribal Groups. There is documented evidence of the religious, ceremonial, and healing uses of peyote dating back over 20,000 years. The tradition began to spread northward as part of a revival of native spirituality under the auspices of what came to be known as the Native American Church, whose members refer to peyote as \"the sacred medicine\", and use it to combat alcoholism and spiritual, physical, and other social ills.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_RING_PEDIA">Kurash is a form of upright jacket wrestling native to Uzbekistan, practiced since ancient times. This Central Asian sport developed thousands of years ago as a form of training for fighting, for both self-defence and war. This is reflected in the rules, where clothing is required which mimics armour or battle-garb, and where grips on the trousers and ground fighting are banned, since bending over low or going to the ground make a fighter vulnerable to weapon thrusts. The emphasis on standing fighting develops strong balance and quick footwork, which help greatly when fighting with weapons.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_RINGFORT_PEDIA">[TAB]Ringforts are fortified settlements that are generally agreed to be from the Early Medieval period in Northern Europe, especially Ireland.  A ráth was made of earth and caiseal or cathair were made of stone.  A dun is a more prestigious site, the seat of a ruler.  Historical or archaeological record of the Early Medieval Period in Ireland doesn't come close to the ringfort.  Over 45,000 sites have been identified as ringforts throughout Ireland, but over 60,000 sites can be identified. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Ringforts are traditionally understood as being a dispersed farmstead, the home of a free man and his family.  This veiw has been altered, saying that not all ringforts are not farmsteads, but that they fill a variety of functions.  Other ringfort sites have provided evidence that ringforts played a significant role in the economy of Ireland.  Excavations have lead to the finding of pottery at ringfort sites suggesting that they may have been used as trading posts or other settlement functions.  Yet another theory is that the ringforts were used for defense both because of its name and archaeological evidence.  Ringforts may have been built to give protection to cattle-farming communities and guard their livestock.  The circular shape of the ringfort also shows its defensive advantages.  Explanations from the Early christian period support another idea: ringforts were built to signify nobility, kingship, and authority.  The more elaborate the ringfort, the higher the status of the occupant.  The promotion of one's status was the main purpose of construction of these ringforts.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_SOMALIA_MOGADISHU_PEDIA">[TAB]The sultanates and republics of Merca, Mogadishu, Barawa, Hobyo and their respective ports became profitable trade outlets for commodities originating from the interior of the State. The farming communities of the hinterland brought their products to the coastal cities, where they were sold to local merchants who maintained a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from Arabia, India, Venetia, Persia, Egypt, Portugal, and as far away as China. Vasco Da Gama, who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century, noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its centre and many mosques with cylindrical minarets.  In the 16th century, Duarte Barbosa noted that many ships from the Kingdom of Cambaya sailed to Mogadishu with cloths and spices for which they in return received gold, wax and ivory. Barbaso also highlighted the abundance of meat, wheat, barley, horses, and fruit on the coastal markets, which generated enormous wealth for the merchants.  Mogadishu, the center of a thriving weaving industry known as toob benadir (specialized for the markets in Egypt and Syria), together with Merca and Barawa also served as transit stops for Swahili merchants from Mombasa and Malindi and for the gold trade from Kilwa.  Jewish merchants from the Hormuz also brought their Indian textile and fruit to the Somali coast in exchange for grain and wood.</string>

It was a large, usually rectangular space surrounded by buildings. Platforms, altars and statues of gods, sportsmen and political figures could also be found there. The stoa, which formed an edge of the agora, was a long building with columns. Shops were located in the stoa. More expensive items could be bought here.[PARAGRAPH:1]In some cities, local councils met in nearby buildings; other buildings were used to store public records and important political documents. Public spectators could watch criminals being placed on trial in the agora.[PARAGRAPH:1]Men and slaves usually did the shopping, with slaves and donkeys carrying the purchases; wealthier women may have visited to buy perfumes, jewellery and expensive cloth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Farmers came with their produce. In the large empty space of the agora, stallholders set up their sun shaded tables and sold such items as meat, fish, fruits and vegetables, cheeses, eggs, honey, wine, olive oil and animals (e.g. donkeys, horses, hens). Fresh meat and fish were displayed on marble slabs that kept the food cool. \"Fast food\" was also sold to hungry and thirsty shoppers. Slaves were placed on display and bought and sold.[PARAGRAPH:1]Merchants also bought and sold exotic foreign items in the agora. Ivory and gems came from Egypt, elephants from India, silk from China, wool from countries surrounding Greece, purple dye from the eastern countries, grain from areas around the Black Sea.[PARAGRAPH:1]Craftsmen had stalls, shops or workshops in or near the agora.

Most of the objects from Noin-Ula are now in the Hermitage Museum, while some artifacts unearthed later by Mongolian archaeologists are on display in the Mongolian National Museum, Ulan Bator. One kurgan contained a lacquer cup inscribed with the name of its Chinese maker and dated September 5, 13 AD.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Noin Ula burials consist of more than 200 large kurgans. Inside the kurgans are timber burial chambers. Noin Ula had horse burials and one tomb had especially lavish furnishings. The coffin was apparently made in China, and the interned person had many of his possessions buried with him. His horse trappings were elaborately decorated and his leather-covered saddle was threaded with black and red wool clipped to resemble velvet. Magnificent textiles included a woven wool rug lined with thin leather with purple, brown, and white felt appliqué work, and textiles of Greco-Bactrian, Parthian and Anatolian origin.[PARAGRAPH:1]Some objects are similar to the artifacts from Pazyryk in the Altay Mountains. As with the finds at Pazyryk, the Noin Ula graves had been flooded and subsequently frozen, thus preserving the organic material to an unprecedented degree. The tombs, plundered in antiquity, formed wooden burial chambers in deep shafts covered by earthen kurgans. Among the burial inventory were artifacts of the Hunnish craftsmen including weaponry, home utensils, art objects, and multiple Chinese artifacts from bronze, nephrite, lacquered wood and textiles. Many artifacts show that Huns actively participated in trade along the Great Silk Road.[PARAGRAPH:1]Among the Noin Ula art works are many imported objects and fragments of fabrics recognized as Greek. The fabric, color, weaving methods and embroidery of the cloth were similar to the cloth produced in the Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast for the Scythians, and from there they were flowing to the Huns, bringing along a knowledge about western countries.
