In the first half of the 18th century, Ablai Khan proved to be a talented organizer and commander as he headed detachments of the Kazakh militia fighting the Dzungars. He participated in the most significant battles against the Dzungars from the 1720s to the 1750s, for which he was declared a \"batyr\" (\"hero\") by the people.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ablai's activity aimed to create a strong and independent Kazakh state. He headed the unified forces of the Kazakhs and furthered the centralization of state power in Kazakhstan. Until his election as the khan of the three jüzes, Ablai had to compete with Khan Abul Mambet and his descendants of Middle jüz for leadership. Initially, Russia recognized Abul Mambet as the Khan of Middle jüz, while Ablai was supported by China. Ablai's talent in playing China against Russia gradually made him the unrivalled Khan of the steppe. Unlike Abul Khair Khan of Little jüz, Ablai never submitted to Russian rule. In 1771, at the meeting of the representatives of the three jüzes, Ablai was elected as the Kazakh khan. Russian Empress requested that the title of khan should be recognized and officially approved by Russia. To that end, she sent an official letter to Petropavl, where Ablai was expected to receive the title in 1779. He never showed up at the fort, declining Russia's request to appoint him as the khan of Middle jüz. In contrast to Ablai, other khans and sultans had been competing for the lavish gifts and stipends of the Emperors of Russia in return for their submission.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the Qing campaigns against the Dzungars, Ablai Khan chose not to take sides in the Dzungar-Chinese conflict. Once the conflict was settled, Ablai offered his submission to the Qianlong Emperor. Ablai was confirmed as Kazakh khan by both the Chinese and the Russians. He lead numerous campaigns against Kokand Khanate and Kyrgyzs. In the last campaign his troops liberated many cities in Southern Kazakhstan and even captured Tashkent. Then he procedeed to present day Kyrgyzstan and won the furious battle with troops of local warlords. Upon his death in 1781 he was interred in the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi in Hazrat-e Turkestan.</string>

The two took possession of the thrown of Mycenae, and so Agamemnon and his brother, Menelaus, went to the king of Sparta.  There, Agamemnon married Clytemnestra, the daughter of Tyndareus, king of Sparta, and had five children.[PARAGRAPH: 1]Agamemnon is known for his role in the Trojan War.  Much of Agamemnon's life is encompassed by myth, so some of the information about the Trojan War is unreliable.  Agamemnon gathered Greek soldiers to sail for Troy.  Agamemnon was the Commander-in-Chief for the Greek Army, and had slain many important people from the Trojan Army.  He killed Antiphus, and Helaesus.  After the war, Cassandra, daughter of Priam, was given to Agamemnon as a prize.[PARAGRAPH: 1]Agamemnon returned to Greece with Cassandra and landed in Argolis.  Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra had taken a lover, Aegistheus, and invited Agamemnon to a banquet.  There, Agamemnon was slain and died.  Clytemnestra then ruled Agamemnon's kingdom for a time, but the murder of Agamemnon was eventually avenged by his son Orestes with the help of his daughter Electra.</string>

Prior to becoming president, Ahmadinejad served as mayor of Tehran, a governor of Kurdistan, Ardabil, and served in the Iran-Iraq War, as a member of Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. He is the highest directly elected official in the country; constitutionally, he has much less power than the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Iran and has the final word in all aspects of foreign and domestic policies.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ahmadinejad is a critic of the George W. Bush Administration and supports strengthened relations with Russia, Venezuela, Syria, and the Persian Gulf states. He has said Iran's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and has refused to end enrichment despite United Nations Security Council resolutions.[PARAGRAPH:1]He has called for the dissolution of the state of Israel and its government, which he does not regard as legitimate or representative of the population,and for free elections in the region. He believes that the Palestinians need a stronger voice in the region's future. One of his most controversial statements was one in which, according to some translations, he called for Israel to be \"wiped off the map,\" but interpretations of this statement vary widely. He has also been condemned for describing the Holocaust as a myth, which has led to accusations of anti-semitism. In response to these criticisms, Ahmadinejad said, \"No, I am not anti-Jew, I respect them very much.\"[PARAGRAPH:1]During his presidency, Ahmadinejad launched a gas rationing plan to reduce the country's fuel consumption and cut the interest rate for private and public banking facilities.</string>

There is not a great deal known about Ajatashatru. What is known is that he became a King of Magadha and the adjoining areas by murdering his father, Seniya/Bimbisara. Also, he was a contemporary of Buddha, was a patron of the then-new religion of Buddhism, and he let the Sangha function in his Kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:1]Some details of his life are given in the earliest Buddhist scriptures of the Pali Canon. In the Samaññaphala Sutta, Gautama Buddha said that if Ajatasattu hadn't killed his father, he would have attained sotapannahood, a degree of enlightenment. But because he had killed his father he could not attain it.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to Romila Thapar, Ajatashatru was responsible for building Pataliputra and strengthening the defences of the Magadhan capital, Rajagriha. The same historian reports that Ajatashatru murdered his father and predecessor Bimbisara in order to accede to the throne. This is also recorded in the Buddhist scripture, the Contemplation Sutra. Next, Ajatashatru, undertook the annexation of the kingdoms of Kosala and Kashi, and pursued a sixteen-year war against the Vriji confederacy of north Bihar and Nepal. Legends say that the one who masterminded Ajatashatru's usurping of the throne was the schismatic monk Devadatta, the reasons being that Ajatashatru was said to have been convinced by Devadatta to help fund his schismatic sangha.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_ALAKSANDU_PEDIA">[H1]Alaksandu[\H1][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Alaksandu was a king of Wilusa who sealed a treaty with Muwatalli II ca. 1280 BC. This treaty implies that Alaksandu had previously secured a treaty with Muwatalli's father, Mursili II, as well.  Alaksandu was a successor of one Kukkunni, although it is not known if he was his immediate successor. Muwatalli recalls the friendship of Kukkunni with his own grandfather, Suppiluliuma I, and further evokes over three centuries of friendship between the Hittites and Wilusa dating back to the reign of Hattusili I.  Muwatalli in his letter downplays the importance of royal ancestry, suggesting that Alaksandu had come to power by other means than regular succession, so that Alaksandu is not necessarily a blood-relation of Kukkunni's. This has been taken as a hint that he may have been an early Greek ruler called Alexander, and he has been associated with Homer's Alexandros of Ilion, who is better known by his nickname Paris, of Troy.  One of three gods guaranteeing the terms of the treaty on the side of Alaksandu is Apaliunas, from whom Apollon apparently derived. The god Apollo is portrayed in the Iliad as the foremost champion of the Trojans and the one who helped Paris kill the otherwise invulnerable Achilles.</string>

Between 395 and 397, he led the Visigoths in devastating Thrace and Greece, sacking several cities including Corinth and Sparta. He invaded Italy in 401 and besieged the Western Roman emperor Flavius Honorius (395-423) in Milan. In 402, after being defeated at Pollentia and Verona by the Western Empire general Stilicho, he moved into the province of Noricum, just north of Italy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following Stilicho's murder in 408, Alaric invaded Italy after Honorius refused to pay him for past services. A siege of Rome was alternately lifted and renewed. Finally, on August 24, 410, after being joined by his relative Athaulf, Alaric captured Rome. The city was sacked for three days; churches were generally left untouched. The damage was more psychological than material. For the first time in 800 years, Rome had fallen. No longer could it be called \"Unconquered Rome.\"[PARAGRAPH:1]Alaric then traveled south, hoping to cross to Sicily, but after the Gothic fleet was wrecked, he turned back north. On this journey, he became ill and died at Cosentia in southern Italy.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is said that Alaric was buried with his treasures in the bed of the Busento River, which was temporarily diverted from its course. That the secret of his burial place might be kept, the slaves employed in the labor were killed.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>

After Audoin died, Alboin, the tenth king entered the government of his country.  He followed the wishes of his people.  Around the same time, Turisund, king of the Gepids, died.  Therefore, his son Cunimund succeeded to the throne.  Although the Gepids had already had a peace treaty with the Langobards, Cunimund broke this treaty.  At this same time, Alboin had made an everlasting treaty with the Avars.  Despite all this, Cunimund continued to force his people to fight.  Cunimund announced that if his people were able to overcome the Langobards, then they would attack the Avars, who now occupied the lands of the Gepids.  Under the leadership of Alboin, the Langobards were victorious.  The Langobards had such a powerful military that they reduced the Gepids to utter destruction.  Alboin killed Cunimund and made a goblet out of his skeleton, known as a scala. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The success of Alboin had spread so far, that word of his powerful military had spread to Rome.  Rome sought out the help of Alboin and the Langobards in their war against the Goths.  The Langobards were transported to Rome by way of the sea.  Much to the hope of the Romans, Alboin had reduced the king of the Goths, Totila, to a state of destruction.  The Langobards returned to their country bearing gifts and riches. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Alboin, after all his military success, now set out for Italy.  He asked for help from the Saxons who in turn supplied him with 20,000 men to proceed to Italy. Alboin hoped to lead his people in a migration to Italy.  He then gave Pannonia, the current home of the Langobards, to the Huns.  The only conditions were that if the Langobards were to ever return, they would be able to take possession of Pannonia immediately.  Alboin first entered Venetia.  Alboin declared that his nephew Gisulf would be the duke once conquered.  Gisulf demanded that Alboin give him any Langobard people of his choice before becoming duke.  Alboin agreed to this condition. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Alboin came to the river Piave first.  The bishop of the church of Tarvisium, Felix, asked the king to grant him the church after the land was conquered.  Alboin was gracious and granted his request.  Alboin then went on to capture the cities of Vicenza, Verona, and the remaining cities of Venetia.  He captured all the cities but Padua, Monselice, and Mantua.  After conquering Venetia, Alboin moved his army to Liguria.  He took all the cities of Liguria except those situated on the shores.  The city of Pavia was one of the hardest cities to take.  It lasted three years and some months to surrender to Alboin after being besieged.  Alboin took possession of everything as far as Tuscany except Rome, Ravenna, and some other fortified places. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The Romans were so devastated by this loss and the disease that occurred.  Alboin had vowed to put all the people of these conquered cities to death.  However, Alboin was a good man.  Alboin broke this vow and allowed the people to live without injury.  Alboin ruled Italy for three and a half years before being assassinated by his wife.  </string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_ALFRED_PEDIA">[H1]Alfred the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of the Anglo-Saxons[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c. 849 AD - 899 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Alfred the Great was known as King Alfred (Aelfred) the Great, or King of Wessex, Alfred the Great became ruler of the West Saxons after he and his brother defeated the Danes in the Battle of Ashdown in Berkshire - the later death of his brother Ethelred left Alfred as successor in 871. He has the reputation of being a great warrior as well as a social reformer who built towns and promoted education by starting schools and translating texts from Latin. He is considered the first King of England.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although the Danes were defeated at Ashdown, the West Saxons were forced to negotiate and pay tribute after losing further battles. But Alfred refused to surrender and in 878, he rallied men from Somerset and Wiltshire and again defeated the Danes in the Battle of Edington. The Danes made peace and Guthrum, their king, was baptised with Alfred as his sponsor. By 886, Alfred had freed London from Danish occupation and a treaty was made with Guthrum and the East Anglians. England was divided, with the east (between the Rivers Thames and Tees) declared to be Danish territory - later known as the 'Danelaw' - where English and Danes were treated as equals by law.[PARAGRAPH:2]The failure of the Danes to make any more advances against Alfred was largely a result of the defensive measures he undertook during the war. He set about strengthening old forts and building new, and he ensured that his army was well organised. He also built up a navy to meet invasions. Larger ships were constructed to his own design for use against the coastal raids that continued even after 896.[PARAGRAPH:2]Alfred understood the value of diplomacy and formed amicable relations with Mercia and Wales; Welsh rulers sought his support and even provided troops for his army in 893. As an administrator Alfred advocated justice and order. He established a code of laws, after studying the principles of law-giving in the Book of Exodus and the codes of Aethelbert of Kent, Ine of Wessex and Offa of Mercia. While avoiding unnecessary changes to custom, he limited the practice of the blood feud and imposed heavy penalties for breach of oath or pledge.[PARAGRAPH:2]A most distinguishing characteristic was Alfred's belief in education. He held the view that Viking raids were a divine punishment for peoples' sins, which he attributed to the decline of learning, and so he offered patronage to scholars from Wales and the continent and he himself learned Latin, eventually translating books into English.[PARAGRAPH:2]Alfred is still considered quintessential as a ruler of the Middle Ages. He resisted constant threat from the Danes while establishing himself as a wise and lawful ruler of not only the Anglo-Saxons, but of England.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_ALOOMA_PEDIA">[H1]Alooma[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mai of the Kanem-Bornu Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1571 - 1603[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Idris Alooma was mai (king) of the Kanem-Bornu Empire, located mainly in Chad and Nigeria. An outstanding statesman, under his rule (1571-1603) Kanem-Bornu touched the zenith of its power. Idris is remembered for his military skills, administrative reforms, and Islamic piety. His feats are mainly known through his chronicler Ahmad bin Fartuwa.[PARAGRAPH:1]His main adversaries were the Hausa to the west, the Tuareg and Toubou to the north, and the Bulala to the east. One epic poem extols his victories in 330 wars and more than 1,000 battles. His innovations included the employment of fixed military camps (with walls); permanent sieges and \"scorched earth\" tactics, where soldiers burned everything in their path; armored horses and riders; and the use of Berber camelry, Kotoko boatmen, and iron-helmeted musketeers trained by Turkish military advisers. His active diplomacy featured relations with Tripoli, Egypt, and the Ottoman Empire, which sent a 200-member ambassadorial party across the desert to Alooma's court at Ngazargamu. Alooma also signed what was probably the first written treaty or cease-fire in Chadian history.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alooma introduced a number of legal and administrative reforms based on his religious beliefs and Islamic law (sharia). He sponsored the construction of numerous mosques and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he arranged for the establishment of a hostel to be used by pilgrims from his empire. As with other dynamic politicians, Alooma's reformist goals led him to seek loyal and competent advisers and allies, and he frequently relied on slaves who had been educated in noble homes. Alooma regularly sought advice from a council composed of heads of the most important clans. He required major political figures to live at the court, and he reinforced political alliances through appropriate marriages (Alooma himself was the son of a Kanuri father and a Bulala mother).[PARAGRAPH:1]Kanem-Bornu under Alooma was strong and wealthy. Government revenue came from tribute (or booty, if the recalcitrant people had to be conquered), sales of slaves, and duties on and participation in trans-Saharan trade. Unlike West Africa, the Chadian region did not have gold. Still, it was central to one of the most convenient trans-Saharan routes. Between Lake Chad and Fezzan lay a sequence of well-spaced wells and oases, and from Fezzan there were easy connections to North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea. Many products were sent north, including natron (sodium carbonate), cotton, kola nuts, ivory, ostrich feathers, perfume, wax, and hides, but the most important of all were slaves. Imports included salt, horses, silks, glass, muskets, and copper.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alooma took a keen interest in trade and other economic matters. He is credited with having the roads cleared, designing better boats for Lake Chad, introducing standard units of measure for grain, and moving farmers into new lands. In addition, he improved the ease and security of transit through the empire with the goal of making it so safe that \"a lone woman clad in gold might walk with none to fear but God.</string>

Kandake ('Candace' in English) was the title for female rulers of the ancient African state of Kush. The capital region of the Kushite empire was centered in Sudan, but the empire extended all through Africa and including Egypt. They formed a series of Nubian warrior queens, queens regnant, and queen mothers that ruled Kush in an unbroken line for over one thousand years. At an earlier period, men had ruled or shared rule with them. By the time of Emperor Augustus, documented accounts of solitary female rulers had emerged.[PARAGRAPH:1]Amanishakheto succeeded the Candace Amanirenas. She was Crown Princess for several years before she became Empress. When the Roman Emperor Augustus attempted to conquer Nubia, she fought the Roman Army in three battles from 24-21 BCE. When the Augustus attempted to tax the Kushites, she and her son Akinidad attacked a Roman fort in Egypt. The Romans eventually negotiated peace. She was succeeded by her daughter, Amanitore.[PARAGRAPH:1]She seems to have reigned from 10 BCE to 1 CE, although most dates of Nubian history before the Middle ages are very uncertain. Amanishakheto is known from several monuments. She is mentioned in the Amun-temple of Kawa, on a stela from Meroe, and in inscriptions of a palace building found at Wad ban Naqa, from a stela found at Qasr Ibrim, another stela from Naqa and her pyramid at Meroe. Her titles were Candace and later qore, which means king.[PARAGRAPH:1]Amanishakheto is best known from a treasure of jewellery recovered in 1834 from her pyramid in Meroe. These pieces are now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin and Munich.</string>

She was born c. 1533 and is estimated to have died around 1610. Amina was a preeminent gimbiya (princess) but various theories exist as to the time of her reign or if she ever was a queen. One explanation states that she reigned from approximately 1536 to 1573, while another posits that she became queen after her brother Karama's death, in 1576. Yet another claims that although she was a leading princess, she was never a queen. The Arabic female name Amina means truthful and trustworthy.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Amina was seven years old her mother, Bakwa Turunku, became queen. During this point in her life, she became involved in the Zazzau military, earning much admiration for her bravery. Her military achievements brought her great wealth and power. She is credited as the architect of the earthen walls around the city of Zaria, for which the providence is named. These walls are often referred to as Ganuwar Amina. It is a subject of debate as to whether or not Amina was actually queen, but she was responsible for conquering many of the cities in the area surrounding Zazzau.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to those who believe that she did ascend to the throne, in her thirty-four year reign she expanded the domaain of Zazzau to its largest size. Some sources state that her main focus was not on the annexation of neighboring lands, but on forcing local rulers to accept vassal status and permit Hausa traders safe passage.[PARAGRAPH:1]The introduction of kola nuts into cultivation in the area is attributed to Amina. A statue at the National Arts Theatre in Lagos State honors her, and multiple educational institutions bear her name.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_ANDRANIK_PEDIA">[H1]Andranik Toros Ozanian[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]National Hero of Armenia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1865 - 1927 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]The first name in the Armenian struggle for national liberation in modern times is Andranik. \"Like an eagle he soars over the mountains and ridges.\" Andranik Toros Ozanian was born in historic Shabin-Karahisar (\"Shabin, the black fortress,\" 80 miles northeast of Erzurum). He was destined more, perhaps, than any of the other Armenian revolutionaries, to provide leadership, rationality, acumen, prudence, and effectiveness to Armenia's rising up against the brutal Ottoman oppression. Even during his adolescence Andranik recognized the pattern of Ottoman oppression and the sufferings of his people. So it was that at the tender age of 22, having lost his wife and two children, Andranik joined a partisan group formed in his native town. Inspired with the ideals of liberation for his people, Andranik went to Constantinople to meet those who had already been deeply involved in the liberation movement. He readily accepted tasks assigned to him.[PARAGRAPH:1]When the leader, Serob Aghbiur, of a fighting group which Andranik had joined, was killed, Andranik was named leader. It was in 1901 when his fighting group held out in the Arakelots Vank against an overwhelmingly superior force that Andranik's name became famous for his effectiveness as a revolutionary leader. There were many more similar occurrences to come. Andranik, at first, joined the Hunchak party; it was through party organization that he could be effective in securing men and material with which to carry on. But disagreement with party policies led Andranik to leave the Hunchak ranks and join the Dashnak party.[PARAGRAPH:1]There too, when that party engaged in practices judged to be wrong in principle, Andranik resigned. During the period 1907-13 Andranik committed his energies to helping the Bulgarian liberation movement. In it he created an Armenian division, which brought honor to itself by its effective participation. For his efforts Andranik was decorated and commissioned an officer. With World War I under way (1914-1918) Andranik went to the Caucasus and assisted in organizing Armenian battle units to fight the Turks alongside the Russian army units. In 1915 Andranik was named commander of all Armenian volunteer units within the Russian army.[PARAGRAPH:1]The overthrow of the Tsarist regime in Russia (1917) and the consequent collapse of the Russian imperial army found Andranik on the side of the working class out of which the social revolution in Russia had arisen. Early in 1918 he began to organize a separate army to liberate western Armenia. Made a Major General, Andranik had many thousands under his command, Armenian soldiers from the old Russian army, and many thousand Armenians who had volunteered from all over the world. However, short on re-sources and back-up military fighting units, Andranik had to abandon his plan to take Erzurum. With the collapse of the Tsarist Russian government an independent Armenian Republic was set up in May 1918. Andranik was in sympathy with the social principles that came with the new Russian order and desired to maintain amicable relations with Russia. However, Armenia's ruling party, the Dashnaks, did not favor such a relationship. As a result Andranik once again had a falling out with them. The brilliant defense of Zangezur (1918-19) under Andranik's command marked the end of his  military career.[PARAGRAPH:1]Leaving Armenian lands he traveled to Europe and eventually to America (1922), finally settling in Fresno, California, with his new wife. His name and fame enabled him to be effective in fund-raising activities in America for aid to Armenian orphans. His life in Fresno, with frequent visits elsewhere in response to calls, was spent very much in the public eye. But his health was failing. While seeking to regain strength in a sanatorium in Chico, California, the death that he had eluded in his many years of fierce battle encounters, now finally caught up with him. The date was August 31, 1927. City-wide public attention was accorded him at his funeral in Fresno, where he was interred (September 7, 1927) in the Ararat Cemetery. A few months later Andranik's remains were exhumed and taken to Paris (accompanied by his widow) for a second funeral service and interment. Few heroes have been as well acclaimed during their lives as was Andranik.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>

Not only had Asia Minor become detached, but the easternmost provinces had broken away, Bactria under the Greek Diodotus of Bactria, and Parthia under the nomad chieftain Arsaces. Soon after Antiochus's accession, Media and Persis revolted under their governors, the brothers Molon and Alexander.  The young king, under the baneful influence of the minister Hermeias, authorised an attack on Judea instead of going in person to face the rebels. The attack on Judea proved a fiasco, and the generals sent against Molon and Alexander met with disaster. Only in Asia Minor, where the king's cousin, the able Achaeus represented the Seleucid cause, did its prestige recover, driving the Pergamene power back to its earlier limits.  In 221 BC Antiochus at last went east, and the rebellion of Molon and Alexander collapsed which Polybios attributes in part to his following the advice of Zeuxis ? rather than Hermeias.  The submission of Lesser Media, which had asserted its independence under Artabazanes, followed. Antiochus rid himself of Hermeias by assassination and returned to Syria  (220 BC). Meanwhile Achaeus himself had revolted and assumed the title of king in Asia Minor. Since, however, his power was not well enough grounded to allow an attack on Syria, Antiochus considered that he might leave Achaeus for the present and renew his attempt on Judea.The campaigns of 219 BC and 218 BC carried the Seleucid armies almost to the confines of Ptolemaic Egypt, but in 217 BC Ptolemy IV confronted Antiochus at the Battle of Raphia and inflicted a defeat upon him which nullified all Antiochus's successes and compelled him to withdraw north of the Lebanon. In 216 BC Antiochus went north to deal with Achaeus, and had by 214 BC driven him from the field into Sardis. Antiochus contrived to get possession of the person of Achaeus (see Polybius), but the citadel held out until 213 BC under Achaeus' widow Laodice and then surrendered.  Having thus recovered the central part of Asia Minor (for the Seleucid government had perforce to tolerate the dynasties in Pergamon, Bithynia and Cappadocia) Antiochus turned to recover the outlying provinces of the north and east. He obliged Xerxes of Armenia to acknowledge his supremacy in 212 BC. In 209 BC Antiochus invaded Parthia, occupied the capital Hecatompylus and pushed forward into Hyrcania. The Parthian king Arsaces II apparently successfully sued for peace.Year 209 BC saw Antiochus in Bactria, where the Greco-Bactrian king Euthydemus I had supplanted the original rebel. Antiochus again met with success.  After sustaining a famous siege in his capital Bactra (Balkh), Euthydemus obtained an honourable peace by which Antiochus promised Euthydemus' son Demetrius the hand of one of his daughters.  From Seleucia on the Tigris he led a short expedition down the Persian Gulf against the Gerrhaeans  of the Arabian coast (205 BC/204 BC). Antiochus seemed to have restored the Seleucid empire in the east, and the achievement brought him the title of \"the Great\" (Antiochos Megas). In 205 BC/204 BC the infant Ptolemy V Epiphanes succeeded to the Egyptian throne, and Antiochus is said (notably by Polybios) to have concluded a secret pact with Philip V of Macedon for the partition of the Ptolemaic possessions. Under the terms of this pact, Macedon were to receive Egypt's around the Aegean Sea and Cyrene while Antiochus would take Cyprus and Egypt.  Once more Antiochus attacked the Ptolemaic province of Coele Syria and Phoenicia, and by 199 BC he seems to have had possession of it before the Aetolian, Scopas, recovered it for Ptolemy. But that recovery proved brief, for in 198 BC Antiochus defeated Scopas at the Battle of Panium, near the sources of the Jordan, a battle which marks the end of Ptolemaic rule in Judea.Antiochus then moved to Asia Minor to secure the coast towns which had belonged to the Ptolemaic overseas dominions and the independent Greek cities. This enterprise brought him into antagonism with Rome, since Smyrna and Lampsacus appealed to the republic of the west, and the tension became greater after Antiochus had in 196 BC established a footing in Thrace. The evacuation of Greece by the Romans gave Antiochus his opportunity, and he now had the fugitive Hannibal at his court to urge him on.  In 192 BC Antiochus invaded Greece with a 10,000 man army, and was elected the commander in chief of the Aetolians. In 191 BC, however, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. The Romans followed up their success by attacking Antiochus in Anatolia, and the decisive victory of Scipio Asiaticus at Magnesia ad Sipylum (190 BC), following the defeat of Hannibal at sea off Side, delivered Asia Minor into their hands.  By the Treaty of Apamea (188 BC) the Seleucid king abandoned all the country north of the Taurus, which Rome distributed amongst its friends. As a consequence of this blow to the Seleucid power, the outlying provinces of the empire, recovered by Antiochus, reasserted their independence.  Antiochus mounted a fresh expedition to the east in Luristan, where he died in an attempt to rob a temple at Elymaïs, Persia, in 187 BC. The Seleucid kingdom as Antiochus left it fell to his son, Seleucus IV Philopator, by his wife Laodice.</string>

He was the probable leader of the Magyar tribe, and the founder of the Arpad dynasty. Arpad was the son of almos.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to medieval chronicles, seven proto-Magyar tribes elected him as the leader of one of those tribes their common leader in Etelkoz around 890. He is said to have been the leader (\"prince\" - fejedelem) of the proto-Magyars for 20 years and to have died in 907. The Byzantine De administrando imperio says around 950: Prior to this Arpad, the Magyars did never have another ruling prince ('archont') and since then up to today the ruling prince of Hungary has been from that family. Other sources however imply that there was a second ruling prince called Kursan, who was either at the same \"level\" with Arpad, or a kind of \"vice-prince\". Based on Arabic sources, Arpad's title seems to have been kende, although some scholars consider Kende to be the name of a person.[PARAGRAPH:1]After several looting raids in Europe (from the 860s onwards), the proto-Magyars in Etelkoz under Arpad, pushed by the Pechenegs from the East, decided to definitively pass the Carpathian Mountains. In 896 they occupied the Upper Tisza river, from there they undertook numerous looting raids in central and western Europe, and in 900/901 they moved to Pannonia. The proto-Magyars entering the Pannonian fields in 896 represented about 200,000 - 250,000 people.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to legends, Arpad is also said to have been holding the first \"parliamentary\" session with 40 other \"nobles\" on horseback before 900 AD.</string>

Arrian reported Arsaces I was descended from Arsaces, son of Phriapites, and that his brother was Tiridates.  Confusion exists among historians as to whether Arsaces I or his brother Tiridates ruled until 211 B.C., but it is generally accepted today that Arsaces I was the king and Arian's references to Tiridates should be attributed to Arsaces.[NEWLINE][TAB]Arsaces I overthrew Andragoras, the Seleucid governor of Parthia and was crowned in 247 B.C. in Asaak (Arshaak), the capital city of Astauene.  Arsaces I had to deal with attempts by Antiochus III to recapture lost Seleucid territories, but evidently succeeded in consolidating control of Parthia, Hyrcania, Herat and Astauene (and possibly Nisaia). Early in his reign of 36 years he invaded and conquered Hyrcania and then, on the death of the elder King Diodotus in Bactria, formed and alliance with Diodotus II. About 228 B.C., Seleucus II Calinicus (247-226 B.C.) gathered an army in Babylon with which he marched east to reclaim the lost satrapies. Arsaces I retreated before him and eventually sought refuge among the Sakae, but circa 227 B.C. he returned victorious to Parthia when other troubles in Syria diverted Seleucus II. Following his death, Seleucus II was succeeded by his elder son Seleucus III Soter who ruled only three years until his murder, to be succeeded in turn by his younger brother Antiochus III (the Great) in 223 B.C. While Antiochus III was concerned with rebellion by two of his generals, the brothers Molon and Alexander, Arsaces  continued to consolidate his position, increase his army, build forts and establish new cities such as Apaortenon, an almost impregnable position.</string>

Askia Muhammad strengthened his country and made it the largest country in West Africa's history. At its peak under Muhammad, the Songhai Empire encompassed the Hausa states as far as Kano (in present-day Nigeria) and much of the territory that had belonged to the Mali Empire in the west. His policies resulted in a rapid expansion of trade with Europe and Asia, the creation of many schools, and made Islam an integral part of the empire.[PARAGRAPH:1]The successor of Sunni Ali Ber, Askia Muhammad was much more astute and farsighted than his predecessor had ever been. He defeated Sunni Baru in two brief battles, thus winning his kingship, and became a great, skilled ruler.[citation needed] He orchestrated a program of expansion and consolidation which extended the empire from Taghaza in the North to the borders of Yatenga in the South; and from Air in the Northeast to Futa Tooro in Senegambia. Instead of organizing the empire along Islamic lines, he tempered and improved on the traditional model by instituting a system of bureaucratic government unparalleled in the Western Sudan. In addition, Askia established standardized trade measures and regulations, and initiated the policing of trade routes. He also encouraged learning and literacy, ensuring that Mali's universities produced the most distinguished scholars, many of whom published significant books. To secure the illegitimacy of his usurpation of the Sonni dynasty, Askia Muhammad allied himself with the scholars of Timbuktu, ushering in a golden age in the city for Moslem scholarship. The eminent scholar Ahmed Baba, for example, produced books on Islamic law which are still in use today. Mahmoud Kati published Tarik al-Fattah and Abdul-Rahman as-Sadi published Tarik ul-Sudan (Chronicle(history) of the Sudan(an ancient reference to Africa, not political Sudan), two history books which are indispensable to present-day scholars reconstructing African history in the Middle Ages. For all his efforts, Mali experienced a cultural revival it had never witnessed before, and the whole land flourished as a center of all things valuable in learning and trade.[PARAGRAPH:1]Askia Muhammad went blind in his old age, and was deposed (removed from the throne) in 1528 by his son Askia Musa at the age of more than eighty years.

He was leader of the Hunnic Empire which stretched from Germany to the Ural River and from the River Danube to the Baltic Sea. During his rule, he was one of the most fearsome of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires' enemies: he invaded the Balkans twice and marched through Gaul (modern France) as far as Orleans before being defeated at the Battle of Chalons. He refrained from attacking either Constantinople or Rome. His story, that the Sword of Attila had come to his hand by miraculous means, was reported by the Roman Priscus.[PARAGRAPH:1]In much of Western Europe, he is remembered as the epitome of cruelty and rapacity. In contrast, some histories and chronicles describe him as a great and noble king, and he plays major roles in three Norse sagas.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 450 Attila had proclaimed his intent to attack the powerful Visigoth kingdom of Toulouse, making an alliance with Emperor Valentinian III in order to do so. He had previously been on good terms with the Western Roman Empire and its de facto ruler Flavius Aëtius. Aëtius had spent a brief exile among the Huns in 433, and the troops Attila provided against the Goths and Bagaudae had helped earn him the largely honorary title of magister militum in the west. The gifts and diplomatic efforts of Geiseric, who opposed and feared the Visigoths, may also have influenced Attila's plans.[PARAGRAPH:1]Attila returned in 452 to claim his marriage to Honoria anew, invading and ravaging Italy along the way. The city of Venice was founded as a result of these attacks when the residents fled to small islands in the Venetian Lagoon. His army sacked numerous cities and razed Aquileia completely, leaving no trace of it behind. Legend has it he built a castle on top of a hill north of Aquileia to watch the city burn, thus founding the town of Udine, where the castle can still be found. Aëtius, who lacked the strength to offer battle, managed to harass and slow Attila's advance with only a shadow force. Attila finally halted at the River Po. By this point disease may have broken out in Attila's camp, thus helping to stop his invasion.[PARAGRAPH:1]Attila's many children and relatives are known by name and some even by deeds, but soon valid genealogical sources all but dry up and there seems to be no verifiable way to trace Attila's descendants. This hasn't stopped many genealogists from attempting to reconstruct a valid line of descent for various medieval rulers. One of the most credible claims has been that of the khans of Bulgaria (see Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans). A popular, but ultimately unconfirmed attempt tries to relate Attila to Charlemagne.</string>

Some archaeologists hold it to be one of the most important archaeological discoveries in this region of the world in the last 30 years, because the main tomb was found intact and untouched by thieves. Sipan is located in the northern part of Peru, close to the coast, in the middle of the Lambayeque Valley, 35 km east of Chiclayo, Peru. Four tombs have been found in Sipán's Huaca Rajada, a mausoleum built by the Moche culture that ruled the northern coast of Peru from around 1 AD to 700 AD.[PARAGRAPH:1]The clothing of this warrior and ruler suggest he was approximately 1.67 m tall. He probably died within three months of governing. His jewelry and ornaments which indicate he was of the highest rank, include pectoral, necklaces, nose rings, ear rings, helmets, falconry and bracelets. Most were of gold, silver, copper, gold and semi-precious stones. In his tomb were found more than 400 jewels.[PARAGRAPH:1]Found on the Lord of Sipan, was a precious necklace with beads of gold and silver in the shape of maní, or peanut kernels to represent the tierra, the earth. The peanut kernels represented the earth to signify that man came from the land, and that when they die, they return back to the earth; the Moches harvested peanuts and knew that they came from the ground, therefore they were symbolic. The necklace itself has 10 kernels to the right that are gold which signifies masculinity and the sun god, while the kernels that are located on the left side are silver to represent femininity and the moon god.[PARAGRAPH:1]Because of his high rank this ruler was buried along with eight people, apparently his wife and two other women (possibly concubines), a military commander, a watchman, a banner holder and a child. Among the animals found was a dog. Below the tomb of the Lord of Sipan, two other tombs were found, a priest and the Old Lord of Sipan.[PARAGRAPH:1]The priest, by DNA analysis carried out, was contemporary with the Lord of Sipan. In the pieces that accompanied him stand out as religious symbols, the cup or bowl for the sacrifices, a metal crown adorned with an owl with its wings extended, and other items for worship of the moon.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_AYUB_KHAN_PEDIA">[H1]Muhammad Ayub Khan[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Second President of Pakistan[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1907 - 1974[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Ayub Khan was born on May 14, 1907, in Haripur British India, in the village of Rehana near the Haripur District of the Northwest Frontier Province (now Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa).  He ethnic origin was Pashtun (or Pathan) of the Tareen tribe.  He was the first child of the second wife of Mir Dad Khan Tareen, who was a Risaldar-Major (the senior most non-commissioned rank) in Hodson's Horse, a cavalry regiment of the pre-independence Indian Army. For his basic education, he was enrolled in a school in Sarai Saleh, which was about four miles from his village and used to go to school on a mule's back. Later he was moved to a school in Haripur, where he started living with his grandmother. He enrolled at Aligarh Muslim University in 1922, but did not complete his studies there, as he was accepted into the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.  Ayub Khan did well at Sandhurst and was given an officer's commission in the British Indian Army on 2 February 1928 and then joined the 1st Battalion of the 14th Punjab Regiment (Sherdils), later known as 5th Punjab Regiment. During World War II, he served as a Lieutenant Colonel on the Burma front for commanding 1st Battalion of 14th Punjab Regiment. Following the war, he joined the fledgling Pakistani Army as the 10th ranking senior officer (his Pakistan Army number was 10). He was promoted to Brigadier and commanded a brigade in Waziristan and then in 1948 was sent with the local rank of Major General to East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh) as General Officer Commanding of 14th Infantry division responsible for the whole East Wing of Pakistan, for which non-combatant service he was awarded the Hilal-i-Jurat (HJ). He returned to West Pakistan in November 1949 as Adjutant General of the Army and then was briefly Deputy Commander-in-Chief.Ayub Khan succeeded General Sir Douglas Gracey as Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army on January 17, 1951, cecoming the first native Pakistani general to hold that position. Therefore, he superseded two of his seniors, Maj Gen Muhammed Akbar Khan and Maj Gen N.A.M. Raza.  Ayub Khan was promoted to C-in-C only due to the death of Maj Gen Iftikhar Khan, who was nominated as the first native C-in-C, but died in an air-crash en route to his C-in-C training in the UK. Iskandar Mirza, Secretary of Defence, was instrumental in Ayub's promotion, commencing a relationship in which Mirza became Governor General of the Dominion of Pakistan and later President of Pakistan, when it became a republic on March 23, 1956. The events surrounding his appointment set the precedent for a Pakistani general being promoted out of turn, ostensibly because he was the least ambitious of the Generals and the most loyal.  Three months before the end of his tenure as Commander-in-Chief, Ayub Khan deposed his mentor, Iskandar Mirza, Pakistan's President, in a military coup - after Mirza had declared martial law and made Ayub martial law commander.  He would later go on to serve in the second cabinet (1954) of Muhammad Ali Bogra as Defence Minister, and when Iskander Mirza declared martial law on October 7, 1958, Ayub Khan was made its chief martial law administrator. Azam Khan (general), Nawab Amir Mohammad Khan and Sandhurst trained General Wajid Ali Khan Burki were instrumental in Ayub Khan's Rise to power. This would be the first of many instances in the history of Pakistan of the military becoming directly involved in politics.As a result of his having control of the Pakistan Army, Ayub deposed Mirza on October 27 in a bloodless coup, sending Generals Wajid Burki, Azam, and Sheikh in the middle of the night to pack Mirza off to exile in England. This was actually welcomed in Pakistan, since the nation had experienced a very unstable political climate since independence.In 1960, he held an indirect referendum of his term in power. Functioning as a kind of electoral college, close to 80,000 recently elected village councilmen were allowed to vote yes or no to the question: \"Have you confidence in the President, Field Marshal Mohammed Ayub Khan?\" Winning 95.6% of the vote, he used the confirmation as impetus to formalise his new system.Ayub moved to have a constitution created, and this was completed in 1961. A fairly secular person by nature, Ayub Khan's constitution reflected his personal views of politicians and the use of religion in politics.  In 1962, he pushed through a new constitution that while it did give due respect to Islam, it did not declare Islam the state religion of the country. It also provided for election of the President by 80,000 (later raised to 120,000) Basic Democratsmen who could theoretically make their own choice but who were essentially under his control. He justified this as analogous to the Electoral College in the United States and cited Thomas Jefferson as his inspiration. The government \"guided\" the press though his take over of key opposition papers and, while Ayub permitted a National Assembly, it had only limited powers.As President, Ayub Khan allied Pakistan with the global U.S. military alliance against the Soviet Union. This in turn led to major economic aid from the U.S. and European nations, and the industrial sector of Pakistan grew very rapidly, improving the economy, but the consequences of cartelization included increased inequality in the distribution of wealth. It was under Ayub Khan that the capital was moved from Karachi to Rawalpindi, in anticipation of the construction of a new capital: Islamabad. In 1960, Khan's government signed the Indus Waters Treaty with archrival India to resolve disputes regarding the sharing of the waters of the six rivers in the Punjab Doab that flow between the two countries. Khan's administration also built a major network of irrigation canals, high-water dams and thermal and hydroelectric power stations.  In 1964, Ayub confident in his apparent popularity and seeing deep divisions within the political opposition, called for Presidential elections.  He was however taken by surprise when despite a brief disagreement between the five main opposition parties ( a preference for a former close associate of Ayub Khan, General Azam Khan as candidate was dropped), the joint opposition agreed on supporting the respected and popular Fatima Jinnah, the sister of the founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah.  Despite Jinnah's considerable popularity and public disaffection with Ayub's government, Ayub won with 64% of the vote in a bitterly contested election on January 2, 1965. The election did not conform to international standards and journalists. It is widely held, that the elections were rigged in favour of Ayub Khan using state patronage and intimidation to influence the indirectly elected electoral college. In the aftermath of the elections his son Gohar ayub was involved in a major clash with opposition activists in their stronghold of Karachi.The turning point in his rule was the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, D and it ended in a settlement reached by Ayub at Tashkent, called the Tashkent Declaration. The settlement was perceived negatively by many Pakistanis and led Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to resign his post and take up opposition to Khan.  According to Morrice James, \"For them [Pakistanis] Ayub had betrayed the nation and had inexcusably lost face before the Indians.\"  The war also increased opposition in East Pakistan [Now Bangladesh] where the Awami League headed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman sought more autonomy for the province.  General Ayub Khan, who had assumed office of the commander in chief in 1951, supported Governor General Ghulam Muhammad when he dismissed the first constituent assembly on the grounds \"The constituent assembly being power hungry and having a tendency of being corrupt.\" Moulvi Tamizuddin, the first speaker of the assembly, challenged the dismissal (he had to take a rickshaw, wear a burka and go through Sindh court backdoor to seek justice for a nation). Sindh court accepted the appeal but the Federal Court dismissed the Sindh court judgment as the \"Doctrine of necessity\". Later on the decision has been the basis of all autocratic adjustments in Pakistan.  These were the years when Pakistan allowed the US to establish a USAF communications monitoring facility near Peshawar at Badaber and use its air space and air bases to conduct high-altitude spy-flights over the USSR. Due to this, and the soon-to-follow U2 incident led Pakistan into an open hostility with the USSR.  In 1969, he opened up negotiations with the opposition alliance, except for Maulana Bhashani and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. However under increasing pressure from Bhutto and Bhashani who were allegedly encouraged to continue the agitation by elements within the Army and in violation of his own constitution which required him to transfer power to the speaker of the assembly. Ayub turned over control of Pakistan to Commander in Chief General Yahya Khan on 25 March 1969, He was the President's most loyal lieutenant, and was promoted over seven more senior generals in 1966 to the army's top post.</string>

He was a direct descendant of Timur through his father, and a descendant also of Genghis Khan through his mother. Following a series of setbacks, he succeeded in laying the basis for the Mughal Empire in India. Babur identified his lineage as Timurid and Chaghatay-Turk, while his origin, milieu, training, and culture were steeped in Persian culture and so he was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with significant literary, artistic, and historiographical results. He bequeathed to his successors, a legacy of toleration for non-Muslims, that would later characterize the character of the Mughal empire at its zenith.[PARAGRAPH:1]He died at the age of 47 on 26 December 1530, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Humayun. Though he wished to be buried in his favourite garden in Kabul, a city he had always loved, he was first buried in a Mausoleum in the capital city of Agra. Roughly nine years later his wishes were fulfilled by Sher Shah Suri and Babur was buried in a beautiful garden Bagh-e Babur in Kabul, now in Afghanistan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Babur's legacy was a mixed one. He is considered a national hero in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. However, the Sikh Guru, Nanak, wrote a series of complaints against Babur in the Guru Granth Sahib, claiming Babur \"terrified Hindustan\" and was a \"messenger of death.\" He also claimed that women with braided hair \"were shaved with scissors, and their throats were choked with dust\" and that \"the order was given to the soldiers, who dishonored them, and carried them away.\" However, by contemporary standards he was particularly liberal, allowing freedom of religion and not interfering with local customs. Indeed some further Sikh texts mention that Babur was blessed by Guru Nanak. His conciliation of enemies instead of outright destruction may have allowed them to regroup and re-attack, but it was far-sighted and allowed him to rule a large empire without too much social upheaval. He also wrote or dictated his extraordinary memoirs, one of the great monuments of Chaghatai literature, and oversaw the beginnings of an artistic and architectural legacy which fused indigenous traditions with those from Iran and Central Asia (such as the domed tomb, the original model for which was the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand). Ultimately this would result in the Mughal empire leaving India with some of the most breathtaking architecture in the world, including Humayun's Tomb, the Taj Mahal and the Pearl Mosque.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_BAIBARS_PEDIA">[H1]Baibars al-Bunduqdari[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Sultan of Egypt and Syria[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1223  1277[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Born in the Crimea, Baibars was a Kipchak Turk.  It was said that he was captured by the Mongols on the Kipchak steppe and sold as a slave, ending up in Syria.  His first master, the emir (prince) of Hama, was suspicious of Baibars because of his unusual appearance (he was dark-skinned, very tall and had a cataract in one of his bluish eyes).  Baibars was quickly sold to a Mamluk officer and sent to Egypt, where he became a bodyguard to the Ayyubid ruler As-Salih Ayyub.Baibars was a commander of the Mamluks in around 1250, when he defeated the Seventh Crusade of Louis IX of France. He was still a commander under Sultan Qutuz at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 when he decisively defeated the Mongols. After the battle Sultan Qutuz was assassinated while on a hunting expedition. It was said that Baibars was involved in the assassination because he expected to be rewarded with the governorship of Aleppo for his military success; but Qutuz, fearing his ambition, refused to give such a post and disappointed him.  Baibars succeeded Qutuz as Sultan of Egypt.He continued what was to become a lifelong struggle against the Crusader kingdoms in Syria, starting with the Principality of Antioch, which had become a vassal state of the Mongols, and participated in attacks against Islamic targets in Damascus and Syria.  In 1263, Baibars attacked Acre, the capital of the remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but was unable to take it. Nevertheless, he defeated the Crusaders in many other battles.  In 1266 Baibars conquered the Christian country of Cilician Armenia, which, under King Hethum I, had submitted to the Mongol Empire. This isolated Antioch and Tripoli, led by Hetum's son-in-law, Prince Bohemond VI. In 1268, Baibars besieged Antioch, capturing the city on May 18. Baibars had promised to spare the lives of the inhabitants, but broke his promise and had the city razed, killing or enslaving the population upon surrender.  This tactic was common in Baibars' campaigns, and was largely responsible for the swiftness of his victories.  Antioch's ruler, Prince Bohemund VI of Antioch, was then left with no territories except the County of Tripoli. Because Prince Bohemund was away during this attack, he was not there to witness the slaughter of his subjects, and so Baibars wrote him a detailed letter describing exactly what methods of torture and brutality he had visited upon the people of Antioch, and concluded the letter by writing, \"If you had been there to see it, you would have wished to have never been born.\"  Baibars then turned his attention to Tripoli, but interrupted his siege there to call a truce in May 1271. The fall of Antioch had led to the brief Ninth Crusade, led by Edward I of England, who arrived in Acre in May of 1271 and attempted to ally with the Mongols against Baibars. So Baibars declared a truce with Tripoli, and also agreed to a truce with Edward (who was never able to capture any territory from Baibars anyway). According to some reports, Baibars tried to have Edward assassinated with poison, but Edward survived the attempt, and returned home in 1272.  In 1277, Baibars invaded the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, then dominated by the Mongols. He defeated a Mongol army at the Battle of Elbistan, captured the city of Kayseri, but was unable to hold any of his Anatolian conquests and quickly withdrew to Syria.Baibars died in Damascus on June 1, 1277. His demise has been the subject of some academic speculation. Many sources agree that he died from drinking poisoned kumis that was intended for someone else.  Some accounts speculate that Baibars himself may have prepared the poison: having been warned by astrologers that a coming lunar eclipse was portentous of the death of a king, he may have intended to poison another prince in order to ward off his own death, and mistakenly imbibed his own poison.  Other accounts suggest that he may have died from a wound while campaigning, or from illness.  He was buried in the Az-Zahiriyah Library in Damascus.</string>

His father, Avgdor Gryn, was a Zionist who inspired David that there will be someday a homeland for the Jewish people.  David Ben Gurion was at the front position of the Labor Zionist movement during the fifteen years preceding the creation of Israel.  He was a strict, frugal optimist who was characterized by his commitment to the creation of a Jewish state.  He stressed that Israel would \"uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens, without distinction of race, creed, or sex. \" [PARAGRAPH: 1] In 1910, Ben Gurion became an editor for the Palestine Labor Party's magazine.  He signed articles as \"Ben Gurion\" meaning \"son of young lion. \"  From this moment on, he was known as David Ben Gurion.  When World War I broke out in 1914, Ben Gurion was arrested by the Turks and expelled from Palestine.  He fled to Egypt, then the United States.  In America, he encouraged the youth to emigrate to Palestine.  In 1917, Ben Gurion organized the Jewish Legion to fight with Britain against the Turks.  In 1918, he returned to Palestine. [PARAGRAPH: 1] For the next 20 years, Ben Gurion devoted his life to Zionism.  He helped organize the Histadrut, which was the General Federation of Jewish Labor.

In 1808 Napoleon installed his brother, Joseph, as King of Spain. This launched a great popular revolt in Spain known as the Peninsular War. In America, as in Spain, regional juntas were formed to resist the new king. Unlike the Spanish junts, however, the American juntas fought against the power of the Spanish king, not only the person of Joseph Bonaparte. That year, the Caracas junta declared its independence from Spain and Bolivar was sent to England along with Andrés Bello and Luis López Mendez on a diplomatic mission. Bolivar returned to Venezuela on June 3, 1811, and delivered his discourse in favor of independence to the Patriotic Society. On August 13 patriot forces under the command of Francisco de Miranda won a victory in Valencia.[PARAGRAPH:1]On July 24, 1812, Miranda surrendered after several military setbacks and Bolívar soon had to flee to Cartagena. From there, Bolivar wrote his famous Cartagena Manifesto in which he argued that New Granda should help liberate Venezuela because their cause was the same and Venezuela's freedom would secure that of New Granada. Bolívar received assistance from New Granada and in 1813 he invaded Venezuela. He entered Merida on May 23 and was proclaimed \"Libertador\" by the people. On June 8 Bolivar proclaimed the \"war to the death\" in favor of liberty. Bolívar captured Caracas on August 6 and two days later proclaimed the second Venezuelan republic. After several battles, Bolivar had to flee once more and in 1815 he took refuge in Jamaica from where he wrote his Jamaica Letter. That same year, Bolívar traveled to Haiti and petitioned its president, Alexander Sabes Petión, to help the Spanish American cause. In 1817, with Haitian help, Bolívar returned to the continent to continue fighting.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Battle of Boyaca of August 7, 1819 resulted in a great victory for Bolivar and the army of the revolution. That year, Bolívar created the Angostura Congress which founded Gran Colombia (a federation of present-day Venezueal, Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador) which named Bolivar president. Royalist opposition was eliminated during the following years. After the victory of Antonio Jose de Sucre over the Spanish forces at the Battle of Pichincha on May 23, 1822, all of northern South America was liberated. With that great victory, Bolivar prepared to march with his army across the Andes and liberate Peru.[PARAGRAPH:1]On July 26, 1822, Bolivar met with José de San Martín at Guayaquil to discuss the strategy for the liberation of Peru. No one knows what took place in the secret meeting between the two South American heroes, but San Martín returned to Argentina while Bolívar prepared to fight against last Spanish bastion in South America. In 1823 Bolivar took command of the invasion of Peru and in September arrived in Lima with Sucre to plan the attack. On August 6, 1824, Bolívar and Sucre jointly defeated the Spanish army in the Battle of Junín. On December 9 Sucre destroyed the last remnant of the Spanish army in the Battle of Ayacucho, eliminating Spain's presence in South America.[PARAGRAPH:1]On August 6, 1825, Sucre called the Congress of Upper Peru which created the Republic of Bolivia in honor of Bolívar. The Bolivian Constitution of 1826, while never enacted, was personally written by Bolívar. Also in 1826, Bolívar called the Congress of Panama, the first hemispheric conference. But by 1827, due to personal rivalries among the generals of the revolution, civil wars exploded which destroyed the South American unity for which Bolívar had fought. Surrounded by factional fighting and suffering from tuberculosis, El Libertador Simón Bolívar died on December 17, 1830.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_BORU_PEDIA">[H1]Brian Boru[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]High King of Ireland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 941 - 1014[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Brian Boru was likely born in 941, though some sources state that he was born as early as 926.  He was born near Killaloe, a town in the region of Thomond where his father, Cennétig mac Lorcáin was king.  When Brian's father died, the kingship of Thomond passed to his older brother, Mathgamain.  When Mathgamain was killed in 976, Brian replaced him and became the King of the entire kingdom of Munster.  Brian Boru belonged to the Dál Cais who occupied a territory across the River Shannon, a territory that would later be known as the Kingdom of Thomond and today encompasses the counties Clare and Limerick.  The Shannon served as an easy route by which raids could be made against the provinces of Connacht and Meath. Brian Boru participated in these early raids along with his brother and father. [PARAGRAPH: 1] After Mathgamain captured the province of Munster, the Eóganacht King organized an anti-Dalcassian alliance.  At the Battle of Sulchoid, the Dalcassian army led by Mathgamain and Boru resolutely defeated the Hiberno Norse army of Limerick and looted the city.  In 976, Mathgamain attended a supposedly peaceful meeting where he was murdered.  Thus, Brian Boru became the new leader of the Dalcassians.  In order to avenge his brother's death, Brian Boru reestablished the Dalcassian control over Munster.  By the end, he had killed several rulers involved in the anti-Dalcassian alliance. [PARAGRAPH: 1] After having rule of the Province of Munster, Brian then set out to extend his authority to the provinces of Leinster and Connacht.  In doing so, he came into conflict with the High King Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill whose power base was in the Province of Meath.  For the next fifteen years, the high King Máel repeatedly lead armies into Leinster and Boru led his naval forces up the River Shannon to attack Connacht and Meath.  Boru developed a military strategy that used the forces on both land and water that would serve him well throughout his career.  In 966, Boru managed to control the Province of Leinster and Munster, while Máel Sechnaill was still in control of the Provinces of Meath, Connacht, and Ulster.  After deposing the King of Leinster, Brian Boru's selected ruler for Munster rebelled against him.  The opposing sides of the armies fought the Battle of Glen Mama.  Brian's army was victorious and captured and sacked the enemy's city. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In the year 1000, King Brian Boru lead a combined Munster-Leinster-Dublin army on an attack on the High King Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill's home in the Province of Meath.  Meath's most important ally was the Province of Connacht.  However, the two provinces were separated by a river giving Boru's naval forces an advantage.   In response to this problem, Máel Sechnaill built two bridges to serve as obstacles and a connection between the Provinces of Meath and Connacht.  In 1002, Máel Sechnaill surrendered his title to Brian Boru.  In order to use the title High King not only as a name but a reliable title, Boru had to extend his authority to the Province of Ulster.  Ulster's geographical location presented a great challenge against Boru's army.  It took Boru ten years of campaigning to achieve his goal.  But gaining entry to the Province of Ulster brought him only halfway to his goal. Brian systematically defeated each of the regional rulers who defied him, forcing them to recognize him as their overlord. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Brian Boru received support from an important monastery in Ireland, Armagh.  Armagh gave him financial support after Brian Boru generously donated gold to the monastery and declared it the religious capital of Ireland.  Máel Mórda mac Murchada of Leinster rose in rebellion in 1012.  Máel Mórda sought out allies with which to defy the High King.  Together, they attacked the Province of Meath and in 1013, Boru led a force from Munster and southern Connacht into Leinster.  The city of Dublin was blockaded by Boru's army.  His army was forced to abandon the siege when they ran out of supplies before the army of Máel Mórda.  Máel Mórda was relying on the thought that if he defied Boru, the rulers of the other Provinces would aid him.  He was wrong, however, with a sole ruler from Ulster providing support.  When Boru returned in 1014, Máel had no other choice but to send his cousin, Sigtrygg, overseas to seek aid. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Sigtrygg sailed to Orkeney Island and the Isle of Man.  All of the men here were in the service of Máel Mórda.  Boru's troops were from Munster and southern Connacht.  Boru lost the support of the King of Meath after a disagreement and was thus at a loss in the battle.  The fighting took place just north of Dublin, at Clontarf.  The Battle of Clontarf resulted in the death of Brian Boru.  There are many legends concerning his death, from dying in a heroic man-to-man combat to being killed fleeing Viking mercenary Brodir while praying in his tent.  It is said that Boru is buried in the grounds of St. Patrick's Cathedral in the city of Armagh.</string>

Botha was a long-time leader of South Africa's National Party and a staunch advocate of racial segregation and the apartheid system. While in power he made some small concessions towards human rights, but he always refused to apologize for apartheid. He refused to testify at the new government's Truth and Reconciliation Commission and was fined and given a suspended jail sentence for his refusal to testify in relation to human rights violations.[PARAGRAPH:1]Botha died of a heart attack at his home in Wilderness on 31 October 2006, aged 90.

He was the son of Beli, King of Alt Clut. His claim to the Fortrean Kingship came through his paternal grandfather, King Nechtan of the Picts. Nennius' Historia Brittonum tells us that Bridei was King Ecgfrith's fratruelis, i.e. maternal first cousin. Bridei's mother was probably a daughter of King Edwin of Deira.  Bridei was one of the more expansionary and active of Fortrean monarchs. He attacked Dunnottar in 680/681, and campaigned against the Orcadian sub-kingdom in 682, a campaign so violent that the Annals of Ulster said that the Orkney Islands were \"destroyed\" by Bridei (\"Orcades deletae sunt la Bruide\"). It is also recorded that, in the following year, Bridei attacked Dundurn in Strathearn. It is clear that, from his base in Fortriu (or Moray), Bridei was establishing his overlordship of the lands to the north, and those to the south, perhaps putting himself in a position to attack the Anglian possessions (or overlordship) which existed in the far south.It is very possible then that Bridei was regarded by Ecgfrith as his sub-king. The traditional interpretation is that Bridei severed this relationship, causing the invervention of Ecgfrith. This led to the famous Battle of Dunnichen in 685, in which the Anglo-Saxon army of Ecgfrith was annihilated. One Irish source reports that Bridei was \"fighting for his grandfather's inheritance,\" suggesting that either Ecgfrith was challenging Bridei's kingship, or more likely given Bridei's earlier campaigns, that Bridei was seeking to recover the territories ruled by his grandfather, but since taken by the English. The consequences of this battle were the expulsion of Northumbrians from southern Pictland (established through, for instance, the Anglian \"Bishopric of the Picts\" at Abercorn) and permanent Fortrean domination of the southern Pictish zone.  Bridei's death is recorded by both the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach under the year 693.</string>

His name means \"elk\" in Old Turkic. The date of his reign is unknown, as the date of the conversion is hotly disputed, though it is certain that Bulan reigned some time between the mid-700s and the mid-800s. Nor is it settled whether Bulan was the Bek or the Khagan of the Khazars.[PARAGRAPH:2]D.M. Dunlop was certain that Bulan was a Khagan; however, more recent works, such as The Jews of Khazaria by Kevin Brook, assume that he was the Bek due to references to him leading military campaigns. Khazar tradition held that before his own conversion, Bulan was religiously unaffiliated. In his quest to discover which of the three Abrahamic religions would shape his own religious beliefs, he invited representatives from each to explain their fundamental tenets. In the end, he chose Judaism.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the Khazar Correspondence, King Joseph traces his lineage back to Bulan. He refers to the reforming Khazar ruler Obadiah as being one of \"the sons of the sons of Bulan\". While Brook assumes this makes Obadiah Bulan's grandson, the Hebrew phrase is less definitive and may allude to a more remote descent. The royal descendants of Bulan are referred to by Khazar researchers as Bulanids, though their self-designation is unknown.[PARAGRAPH:2]Khazar scholars sometimes refer to the king who led the Khazar conversion to Judaism as \"Bulan Sabriel\", though it is conceivable that they may have been different people.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_BUREBISTA_PEDIA">[H1]Burebista[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Getai and Dacians[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ruled: [\BOLD] 1st Century BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The development of a La Tène-based economy in 3rd-2nd century BC allowed the consolidation of political power through tribal unions. Such regional unions were found both among the Transilvanian Dacians (under the rule of Rubobostes) and the Moldavian and Wallachian Getae (with a center of power in Argedava). Burebista was the first to create a union of tribes of both Dacians and the Getae.  This tribe alliance was probably a weakly-centralized state, with a military organization, similar to the one of the Hellenistic Kingdoms.  The exact degree of centralization is still under debate, with some archaeologists, such as K. Lockyear, denying the existence of a state, because the archaeological evidence shows much regional diversity, with only a few regional-wide trends. Other archaeologists, such as A. Diaconescu, dispute this and consider that there was a centralized political structure. Nevertheless, due to a number of archaeological factors, it's unlikely there'd be found a definite answer to this question.  During Burebista, the society in the region is sometimes considered to have started developing a system of slavery similar to the one in Rome and Ancient Greece, but probably most of the production was still made by free people.  Strabo wrote that Burebista was able to obtain the complete obedience of his tribe with the help of Decaeneus, a wizard and a diviner who learnt his craft in Egypt. The people's obedience to Burebista was so complete, that they were even persuaded to cut their vines and give up drinking wine.  Jordanes further claims that the high priest held \"almost royal powers\" and taught the Dacians a code of laws called the \"belagines laws\", but also ethics, philosophy and sciences, including physics and astronomy.  In the heart of Burebista's empire, in the Orastie Mountains, he built a a system of stone fortifications on higher ground, the most important of such hill forts are located today in the villages of Costesti, Blidaru, Piatra Rosie and Banita.  Burebista led a policy of conquest of new territories: in 60/59 BC, he attacked and vanquished the Celtic tribes of Boii and Taurisci, who dwelt along the Middle Danube and in what is now Slovakia. After 55 BC and probably before 48 BC, Burebista conquers the Black Sea shore, subjugating the Greek fortresses from Olbia to Apollonia, as well as the Danubian Plain all the way to the Balkans.  Strabo also mentions the expeditions against a group of Celts who lived among the Thracians and Illyrians (probably the Scordisci).  The only Greek polis with which Burebista had good relations was Dionysopolis. According to an inscription found in this city, Akornion, a citizen of the city was a chief adviser of Burebista.  At its peak of power, the empire of Burebista streched from Slovakian Carpathians to the Balkans and from the Middle Danube to the Black Sea. Strabo claims that the Getae could raise up to 200,000 soldiers in wartime, a rather improbable number, but which could represent the total number of able males, not the number of any army. Burebista was a worthy adversary for the Romans, as his army would cross the Danube and plunder the Roman towns as far as in Thrace, Macedonia and Illyria.  In 48 BC, Burebista sided with Pompey during his struggle against Julius Caesar in the Roman civil war, sending Akornion as an ambassador and a military adviser. After Caesar emerged as victor, he planned on sending legions to punish Burebista, but he was assassinated in the Senate before he could do so, on March 15, 44 BC.Burebista was assassinated in a plot made by the tribal aristocracy, which felt that a consolidation towards a centralized state would reduce their power. After his death, the empire was dissolved, with the exception of the nucleus around the Orastie Mountains, while the rest being divided into various kindoms.  When Augustus Caesar sent an army against the Getae, the former state of Burebista was divided into four states.</string>

Although the extent of this is uncertain, his dominance was felt by the Gall Gaidel sea-kingdoms in the Irish Sea, and the Isles (possibly within Canute's overlordship since his English conquest), in the Sea of the Hebrides. At the height of his reign, certain Gaelic kingdoms, the Isle of Man, and Dublin, were in clientage.[PARAGRAPH:1]Upon Sweyn Forkbeard's death, Canute's brother Harald was King of Denmark. It is thought Canute went to Harald to ask for his assistance in the conquest of England, and the division of the Danish kingdom. His plea for division of kingship was denied, though, and the Danish kingdom remained wholly in the hands of his brother, although, Harald lent to Canute the command of the Danes in any attempt he was of a mind to lead on the English throne. Harald probably saw it was out of his hands anyway. It was a vendetta that held his brother, Canute, and the Vikings driven away in spite of their conquest with Forkbeard. They were bound to fight again, on the basis of vengeance for their slight. It is possible Harald was at the siege of London, and the King of Denmark was content with Canute in control of the army. His name was to enter the fraternity of Christ Church, Canterbury, at some point, in 1018, although it is unsure if it was before or after he was back in Denmark. In 1018, Harold II died and Canute went to Denmark to affirm his succession to the Danish crown. With a letter written in 1019 he states his intentions to avert troubles to be done against England. It seems Danes were set against him, while an attack on the Wends of Pomerania, in which Godwin apparantly earnt the king's trust with a raid he lead himself at night, was possibly in relation with this. In 1020 he was back in England, his hold on the Danish throne presumably stable. Ulf Jarl, his brother-in-law, was his appointee as the Earl of Denmark. Canute's son, Harthacanute was left in his care. When the Swedish king Anund Jakob and the Norwegian king Olaf Haraldsson took advantage of Canute's absence and began to launch attacks against Denmark, Ulf gave the discontent freemen cause to take Harthacanute, still a child, as king. This was a ruse of Ulf's, since the role he had as the caretaker of Harthacanute subsequently made him the ruler of the kingdom. When news of these events came to Canute, in 1026, he brought together his forces, and, with Ulf in line again, won Denmark supremacy in Scandinavia, at the Battle of Helgeå. This service, did not, though, earn the usurper the forgiveness of Canute for his coup. At a banquet in Roskilde, the brothers-in-law were sat at a game of chess and an argument arose between them, and the next day, Christmas of 1026, one of Canute's housecarls, with his blessing, killed Ulf Jarl, in the Church of Trinity. Contradictory evidences of Ulf's death gather doubt to these circumstances though. Evidence for the years of Canutes reign in Denmark, with his mainstay in England, is generally scanty.[PARAGRAPH:1]Canute died in 1035, at Shaftesbury, Dorset. He was buried in the Old Minster in Winchester. After the Norman Conquest the new regime was keen to signal its arrival by an ambitious programme of grandiose cathedrals in England. Winchester Cathedral was built on an old Anglo-Saxon site. Canute's bones, along with Emma of Normandy's and Harthacanute's, were set in a mortuary chest. In the English Civil War, in the 17th century, plundering soldiers scattered the bones in the various chests along with those of other English kings and queens, such as king Edwy and his queen Elgiva, and William Rufus. His daughter was set to marry Conrad II's son Henry III eight months after his death. On his death Canute was succeeded in Denmark by Harthacanute, reigning as Canute III. Harold Harefoot laid claim on the throne in England until his death in 1040. Harthacanute was to reunite the two crowns of Denmark and England until his death in 1042. Canute's line came to an end, although his legacy did not. The house of Wessex was to reign once more through Edward the Confessor, who Harthacanute had brought out of exile in Normandy and made peace with. It meant the throne was Edward's if he died with no legitimate male heir. Edward was crowned King, and the Norman influence at Court was on the rise: pure Viking and Anglo-Saxon influence in England was past, although it must be remembered that the Normans themselves were of Viking descent.</string>

He supported his family (including his mother and 7 younger siblings) from age 16 on after the death of his father. He worked in a printing shop; although he had little formal education he used every opportunity to educate himself.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cárdenas originally set his sights at becoming a teacher, but was drawn into politics and the military during the Mexican Revolution after Victoriano Huerta overthrew President Francisco Madero. He backed Plutarco Elías Calles, and after Calles became President, Cárdenas became governor of Michoacán in 1928. He became known for his progressive program of building roads and schools and the unusual strict honesty of his administration.[PARAGRAPH:1]Calles continued to dominate Mexico after his presidency with administrations which were his puppets. He selected Cárdenas to be the PRI's presidential candidate on the assumption that he could control Cárdenas as he had controlled others. Cárdenas's first move once in office was to have his presidential salary cut in half. Even more surprising moves would follow. After establishing himself in the presidency, Cárdenas had Calles and dozens of his corrupt associates arrested or deported to the United States, which was greeted with great enthusiasm by the majority of the public.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1938 Cárdenas nationalized Mexico's petroleum reserves and expropriated the equipment of the foreign oil companies in Mexico. Even though compensation for the expropriated assests was included in this legislation, this move aroused considerable hostility in the international business community and foreign governments, and Mexican oil and other goods were boycotted. However, with the outbreak of World War II, oil became a highly sought-after commodity and the boycott ended.[PARAGRAPH:1]After his presidential term he served as Mexico's secretary of defense through 1945.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is often said that Cárdenas was the only president from the PRI who did not use the office to make himself wealthy. He retired to a modest home by Lake Pátzcuaro and worked the rest of his life supervising irrigation projects and promoting free medical clinics and education for the nation's poor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lázaro Cárdenas died of cancer in Mexico City.

[PARAGRAPH:1]Casimir is the only Polish king who did receive and maintain the title of the great in Polish history (Boleslaw I Chrobry was once also called the great, but not today), and the title is well deserved. When he received the crown, his hold on it was in danger, as even his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him \"king of Krakow. The economy was ruined, and country was depopulated and tired with wars. At the time of his death, it had doubled in land area (mostly through joining lands in today's Ukraine, then Duchy of Halicz), grew prosperous, wealthy and had great prospects to the future. Although he is depicted as a peaceful king in children books, he in fact waged many victorious wars and was preparing other ones just before he died. [PARAGRAPH:1]He built many new castles, reformed the Polish army, as well as Polish civil and criminal laws. At the Sejm in Wislica, March 11, 1347, he introduced salutary legal reforms in the jurisprudence of his country. He sanctioned a code of laws for Great and Little Poland, which gained for him the title of \"the Polish Justinian\". He founded the University of Krakow although his death stalled the development of the university (and that's why today it is called Jagiellonian instead of Casimirian).He organised a meeting of kings in Krakow in 1364 which showed the wealth of Polish kingdom. [PARAGRAPH:1]Casimir was sonless. Apparently he deemed his own descendants either unsuitable to inherit or too young. Thus, and in order to provide a clear line of succession instead of problems of uncertainty, he arranged his sister Elisabeth, Dowager Queen of Hungary, and her son Louis king of Hungary to be his successors in Poland. Louis was proclaimed king in Casimir's death 1370, and Elisabeth held much of the practical power until her death in 1380.</string>

He is currently the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was born into a wealthy family and acquired a law degree. While studying at Havana University, he began his political career and became a recognized figure in the politics of Cuba. His political carreer continued with nationalist critiques of Fulgencio Batista, and of the United States' political and corporate influence in Cuba. He gained an ardent, but limited, following and also drew the attention of the authorities. He eventually led the failed 1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks, after which he was captured, tried, incarcerated and later released. He then traveled to Mexico to organize and train for an assault on Batista's Cuba. He and his fellow revolutionaries left Mexico for the East of Cuba in December 1956.[PARAGRAPH:1]Castro came to power as a result of the Cuban revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, and shortly thereafter became Prime Minister of Cuba. In 1965 he became First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba and led the transformation of Cuba into a one-party socialist republic. In 1976 he became President of the Council of State as well as of the Council of Ministers. He also held the supreme military rank of Comandante en Jefe (\"Commander in Chief\") of the Cuban armed forces.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following intestinal surgery from an undisclosed digestive illness believed to have been diverticulitis, Castro transferred his responsibilities to the First Vice-President, his younger brother Raúl Castro, on July 31, 2006. On February 19, 2008, five days before his mandate was to expire, he announced he would neither seek nor accept a new term as either president or commander-in-chief. On February 24, 2008, the National Assembly elected Raúl Castro to succeed him as the President of Cuba.[PARAGRAPH:1]Many describe him as a dictator and his rule has been the longest ever in modern Latin American history. Human rights organizations accuse him of creating a \"repressive machinery\". According to the Human Rights Watch, Castro constructed a \"repressive machinery\" which continues to deprive Cubans of their basic rights.[PARAGRAPH:1]Fabian Escalante, who was long tasked with protecting the life of Castro, estimated the number of assassination schemes or attempts by the CIA to be 638. Some such attempts allegedly included an exploding cigar, a fungal-infected scuba-diving suit, and a mafia-style shooting. Some of these plots are depicted in a documentary entitled 638 Ways to Kill Castro. One of these attempts was by his ex-lover Marita Lorenz whom he met in 1959. She allegedly agreed to aid the CIA and attempted to smuggle a jar of cold cream containing poison pills into his room. When Castro realized, he reportedly gave her a gun and told her to kill him but her nerve failed. Castro once said, in regards to the numerous attempts on his life he believes have been made, \"If surviving assassination attempts were an Olympic event, I would win the gold medal.\"[PARAGRAPH:1]By wearing military-style uniforms and leading mass demonstrations, Castro projected an image of a perpetual revolutionary. He was mostly seen in military attire, but his personal tailor, Merel Van 't Wout, convinced him to occasionally change to a business suit. Castro is often referred to as \"Comandante\", but is also nicknamed \"El Caballo\", meaning \"The Horse\", a label that was first attributed to Cuban entertainer Benny Moré, who on hearing Castro passing in the Havana night with his entourage, shouted out \"Here comes the horse!\" During the revolutionary campaign, fellow rebels knew Castro as \"The Giant\". Large throngs of people gathered to cheer at Castro's fiery speeches, which typically lasted for hours. Many details of Castro's private life, particularly involving his family members, are scarce as the media is forbidden to mention them. Castro's image appears frequently in Cuban stores, classrooms, taxicabs, and national television. Castro has stated that he does not promote a cult of personality.</string>

Modern scholars think they were led by Changamire Dombo, whose power was based in Butua in the southwest. The Rozwi were formed from several Shona states that dominated the plateau of present-day Zimbabwe at the time. They drove the Portuguese off the central plateau, and the Europeans retained only a nominal presence at one of the fairs in the eastern highlands.  Changamire brought the whole of present-day Zimbabwe under his control, forming a polity that became known as the Rozwi Empire. This fierce tribe of warriors was to be known as the Rozvi people.  They established their capital at Danamombe, also known as Dhlo-Dhlo.  Many sources see the Rozvi not as a recovering segment of the Mutapa people, but in fact a people in its own right emerging under the wing of the Mutapa (compare the rise of the Khumalo from under the Zulu nation). The administrative power of the Mutapa began to fail to control the whole empire, and tributaries began to exert more independence.  A leader of the people of guruuswa, given the title Changamire and known as Dombo, became independent from the Mutapa. When the Portuguese tried to colonize, Changamire Dombo led rebellions against their rule. The area of the Rozwi empire fluctuated. Its influence extended over much of present-day Zimbabwe, westward into Botswana, and southward into northeastern South Africa.</string>

He left the country three years later to conduct a series of battles abroad.  At this time, Denmark-Norway, Saxony, and Russia were united in an alliance against Sweden.  Charles's first campaign to deal with these problems was against Denmark-Norway.  After receiving help from England and the Netherlands, Charles quickly defeated the Danes and caused them to submit to peace in 1700.  Now having defeated Denmark-Norway, the young King turned his attention to Poland and Russia. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Russia began the war with an attack on the Swedish territories of Livonia and Estonia.  Charles met the Russian army in the Battle of Narva.  With Charles's clever tactics, the Swedish army won a surprising victory over the Russians, whom outnumbered them four to one.  Rather than pursuing the Russians, Charles transferred his attention to Poland-Lithuania.  Charles captured many Polish cities and defeated their king in 1702. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Despite Charles's success over Poland-Lithuania, the Russian army proved a greater threat.  The Russian Tsar Peter the Great began a military reform plan that deepened the danger of the Russian army.  Charles sought the aid of the Ukrainian Cossacks and the Polish king.  However, Charles's army was so quickly defeated that the allies had no time to combine.  By the time of the crucial Battle of Poltava, Charles was injured and much of his army and supplies were destroyed.  The battle proved catastrophic, and the king fled to the Ottoman Empire. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Once safely located in the Ottoman Empire, Charles incited the king to attack the Russians.  However, the sultan soon grew tired of this and exiled Charles to Constantinople.  During this time, Russia and Poland recovered and increased their territory.  Charles escaped Constantinople and attempted to reestablish the Swedish Empire.  He invaded Norway in 1716, but soon other problems occupied Charles that lead to his defeat.  In 1718 Charles invaded Norway once again, but he was fatally hit by a bullet on December 11, 1718.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_CHAVEZ_PEDIA">[H1]Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Venezuela  [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD]July 28, 1954 - Present[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias is the current President of Venezuela. As the leader of the Bolivarian Revolution, Chavez promotes a political doctrine of democratic socialism and Latin American integration. He is also a critic of neoliberalism, globalization and United States foreign policy. A career military officer, Chavez founded the left-wing Fifth Republic Movement after orchestrating a failed 1992 coup d'etat against former President Carlos Andres Perez. Chavez was elected President in 1998 with a campaign centering on promises of aiding Venezuela's poor majority, and was reelected in 2000 and in 2006. Domestically, Chavez has maintained nation wide Bolivarian Missions, whose goals are to combat disease, illiteracy, malnutrition, poverty, and other social ills. Abroad, Chávez has acted against the Washington Consensus by supporting alternative models of economic development, and has advocated cooperation among the world's poor nations, especially those in Latin America.	Chavez's policies have evoked controversy in Venezuela and abroad, receiving anything from vehement criticism to enthusiastic support. The government of the United States claims that Chavez is a threat to democracy in Latin America. Others sympathize with his ideology or welcome his bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements. In 2005 and 2006 he was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people. After a two-year imprisonment, Chavez was pardoned by President Rafael Caldera in 1994. Upon his release, Chavez reconstituted the MBR-200 as the Fifth Republic Movement (MVRMovimiento Quinta Republica, with the V representing the Roman numeral five). Later, in 1998, Chavez began to campaign for the presidency. In working to earn the trust of voters, Chavez drafted an agenda that drew heavily on his ideology of Bolivarianism. Chavez and his followers described their aim as \"laying the foundations of a new republic\" to replace the existing one, which they cast as \"party-dominated\"; the current constitution, they argued, was no more than the 'juridico-political embodiment of puntofijismo,' the country's traditional two-party patronage system.	Chavez utilized his flamboyant public speaking style, which was noted for its abundance of colloquialisms and ribald manneron the campaign trail to win the trust and favour of a primarily poor and working class following. By May 1998, Chavez's support had risen to 30% in polls, and by August he was registering 39%. Chavez went on to win the 1998 presidential election on December 6, 1998 with 56% of the votes. Chavez was sworn in as president on February 2, 1999. Among his first acts was the launching of Plan Bolivar 2000, which included road building, housing construction, and mass vaccination. Chavez also halted planned privatizations of, among others, the national social security system, aluminum industry holdings, and the oil sector.[26] Chavez also overhauled the formerly lax tax collection and auditing systemespecially regarding major corporations and landholders.	Responding to the stalling of his legislation in the National Assembly, Chavez scheduled two national elections for July 1999, including a referendum for and elections to fill a new constitutional assembly. The Constitutional Assembly was created when the referendum passed with a 72% \"yes\" vote, while the pro-Chávez Polo Patriotico (\"Patriotic Pole\") won 95% (120 of the total 131) of its seats. In August 1999, the Constitutional Assembly's \"Judicial Emergency Committee\" declared a \"legislative emergency\" whereby a seven-member committee conducted the National Assembly's functions; meanwhile, the National Assembly was prohibited from holding meetings. The Constitutional Assembly drafted the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution, which included an increase in the presidential term from five to six years, a new presidential two-term limit, a new provision for presidential recall elections, renaming of the country to Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela, expanded presidential powers, conversion of the bicameral National Assembly into a unicameral legislature, merit-based appointments of judges, and creation of the Public Defender, an office authorized to regulate the activities of the presidency and the National Assembly.	In December 1999, the new constitution was approved. On December 15, after weeks of heavy rain, statewide mudslides claimed the lives of an estimated 30,000 people. Critics claim Chavez was distracted by the referendum and that the government ignored a civil defense report, calling for emergency measures, issued the day the floods struck. The government rejected these claims. Chavez personally led the relief effort afterwards. With respect to domestic policies, critics claim that both corruption and crime are rampant. They also cite a failing infrastructure and public hospitals. Criticism from Chavez supporters arises from reports that Chavez is not fulfilling his major campaign pledges with respect to labor and land reform. Critics charged that the Chávez government has engaged in \"gigantic fraud\" during the 2004 recall referendum, though all international observers and exit polls confirmed the official result. The United States government claims that his cooperation in their war on terror is negligible or purposely indifferent with regards to the FARC and ELN, who are engaged in a conflict with the US-backed Colombian government; nonetheless, the US government says there is no evidence of a direct link between violent groups opposed to its policies and Chavez.	Several public figures have even gone so far as to call for the assassination of Chavez, most notably US Conservative Christian televangelist Pat Robertson. Other such requests have been expressed by Venezuelan actor Orlando Urdaneta and former president of Venezuela Carlos Andres Perez. The US Ambassador to Venezuela between 2001 and 2004, Charles Shapiro, also reported to the Chavez administration two potential assassination plots. Chavez has been accused of concentrating power of judicial and legislative branches. The leading business daily of Argentina, Ambito Financiero, predicted that Venezuela under Chavez in 2007 would have a \"nationalized economy, out-of-control spending, government by decree, and perpetual re-election.\" The motion which included the provision to allow indefinite presidential re-election was voted down in national referendum in 2007. The daily also compared Chavez to King Louis XIV of France, stating his 2007 inauguration would mark \"a concentration of power without precedent in Venezuela.\"		</string>

He is sometimes referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway. Mecklenburg-Schwerin, he was born at Frederiksborg castle in 1577, and succeeded to the throne on the death of his father (April 4, 1588), attaining his majority on August 17, 1596. On November 30, 1597 he married Anne Catherine of Brandenburg, a daughter of Joachim Friedrich, margrave of Brandenburg and duke of Prussia. The queen died fourteen years later, after bearing Christian six children. Four years after her death the king privately wedded a handsome young gentlewoman, Kirsten Munk, by whom he had twelve children  a connection which was to be disastrous to Denmark.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is believed that he, counting both legitimate and illegitimate, had at least 26 children, quite possibly more. He descended, through his mother's side, from king Hans of Denmark, thus uniting the senior branch' descent to the crown. He is frequently remembered as one of the most remarkable Danish kings, having initiated many reforms and projects, and ruling for just under sixty years.[PARAGRAPH:1]Christian IV was now a broken man. His energy was temporarily paralysed by accumulated misfortunes. Not only his political hopes, but his domestic happiness had suffered shipwreck. In the course of 1628 he discovered a scandalous intrigue of his wife, Christina Munk, with one of his German officers; and when he put her away she endeavoured to cover up her own disgrace by conniving at an intrigue between Vibeke Kruse, one of her discharged maids, and the king. In January 1630 the rupture became final, and Christina retired to her estates in Jutland. Meanwhile Christian openly acknowledged Vibeke as his mistress, and she bore him a numerous family. Vibeke's children were of course the natural enemies of the children of Christina Munk, and the hatred of the two families was not without influence on the future history of Denmark. Between 1629 and 1643, however, Christian gained both in popularity and influence. During that period he obtained once more the control of the foreign policy of Denmark as well as of the Sound Tolls, and towards the end of it he hoped to increase his power still further with the assistance of his sons-in-law, Corfitz Ulfeldt and Hannibal Sehested, who now came prominently forward.[PARAGRAPH:1]The last years of the king were still further embittered by sordid differences with his sons-in-law, especially with the most ambitious of them, Corfitz Ulfeldt. On February 21, 1648, at his earnest request, he was carried in a litter from Frederiksborg to his beloved Copenhagen, where he died a week later. He was buried in Roskilde Cathedral. Christian IV was a good linguist, speaking, besides his native tongue, German, Latin, French and Italian. Naturally cheerful and hospitable, he delighted in lively society; but he was also passionate, irritable and sensual. He had courage, a vivid sense of duty, an indefatigable love of work, and all the inquisitive zeal and inventive energy of a born reformer. His own pleasure, whether it took the form of love or ambition, was always his first consideration. In the heyday of his youth his high spirits and passion for adventure enabled him to surmount every obstacle with plan. But in the decline of life he reaped the bitter fruits of his lack of self-control, and sank into the grave a weary and brokenhearted old man.[PARAGRAPH:1]Christian founded a large number of towns and buildings in his countries. These include: Christianshavn, Christiania (now Oslo, modern capital of Norway, founded after a fire destroyed the original city in 1624), Glückstadt (founded as a rival to Hamburg), Christianstad, and Christiansand. Two short-lived towns were Christianspris in Schleswig near Kiel and Christianopel near the Swedish border. Two settlements were constructed for industrial purposes: Kongsberg in Norway to mine a silver deposit and Kobbermølle in Schleswig as a copper mill.</string>

By his nomen, it can be told that he (or one of his male ancestors) was made a Roman citizen (and thus, the tribe a Roman vassal) by either Augustus or Caligula.[NEWLINE][TAB] He was twice imprisoned on a charge of rebellion, and narrowly escaped execution. During the disturbances that followed the death of Nero, he took up arms under pretence of siding with Vespasian and induced the inhabitants of his native country to rebel. The Batavians, who had rendered valuable aid under the early emperors, had been well treated in order to attach them to the cause of Rome. They were exempt from tribute, but were obliged to supply a large number of men for the army, and the burden of conscription and the oppressions of provincial governors were important incentives to revolt. The Batavians were immediately joined by several neighbouring German tribes, the most important of whom were the Frisians.[NEWLINE][TAB]  The Roman garrisons near the Rhine were driven out, and twenty-four ships captured. Two legions under Mummius Lupercus were defeated at Castra Vetera (near the modern Xanten) and surrounded. Eight cohorts of Batavian veterans joined their countrymen, and the troops sent by Vespasian to the relief of Vetera threw in their lot with them.[NEWLINE][TAB]The result of these accessions to the forces of Civilis was rising in Gaul.  Hordeonius Flaccus was murdered by his troops, and the whole Roman forces were induced by two commanders of the Gallic auxiliaries - Julius Classicus and Julius Tutor - to revolt from Rome and join Civilis.  The whole of Gaul thus practically declared itself independant, and the foundation of a new kingdom of Gaul was comptemplated.  The prophetess Veleda predicted the compelte success of Civilis and the fall of the Roman Empire.  But disputes broke out amoungst the different tribes and rendered co-operation impossible; Vespian, having successfully ended the civil war, called upon Civilis to lay down his arms, and on his refusal resolved to take strong measures for the suppression of the revolt.[NEWLINE][TAB]The arrival of Quintus Petillius Cerialis with a strong force awed the Gauls and mutinous troops into submission; Civilis was defeated at Augusta Treverorum (Trier, Trèves) and Castra Vetera, and forced to withdraw to the island of the Batavians. He finally came to an agreement with Cerialis whereby his countrymen obtained certain advantages, and resumed amicable relations with Rome. From this time Civilis disappears from history.</string>

Changes have also occurred in tertiary-education financing, with the abolition of interest on student-loans  firstly for those currently studying, then extended to all borrowers living in New Zealand. Other changes introduced during Clark's term in office include legal provision for civil unions, the introduction of 14 weeks' paid parental leave, and the Property (Relationships) Act.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even though some commentators saw stable government within the relatively new MMP electoral system as unlikely, Clark's supporters credit her with maintaining two terms of stable MMP government, as well as being able to form the current government given the close election result.

Cochise was described as a large man (for the time), with a muscular frame, classical Roman features, and long black hair which he wore in traditional Apache style. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cochise and the Chokonen-Chiricahua lived in the area that is now the northern Mexican region of Sonora, and New Mexico and Arizona, which were traditional Apache territories until the coming of the Europeans. Due to encroachment by Spain and later Mexico, the Chokonen and Nednhi-Chiricahua became increasingly dependent upon food rations issued by the Mexican government to placate them. When this practice was abruptly ended in 1831, the various Chiricahua bands resumed raids to acquire food. Mexican troops were largely unsuccessful in their attempts to address this and were often fought to a standstill by the Apache. As part of their attempts at controlling the Chiricahua, Mexican forces, often with the help of American and Native American mercenaries, began to kill Apache civilians, including Cochise's father. Mexican forces were finally able to capture Cochise in 1848 during an Apache raid on Fronteras, Sonora, but they exchanged him for nearly a dozen Mexican hostages. [PARAGRAPH:1]At Apache Pass in 1862, Cochise and his father-in-law, Mangas Coloradas, with 500 fighters, held their ground against a force of 3,000 California volunteers under Carleton until howitzer artillery fire was brought to bear on their position. The impasse continued until both parties agreed to parley. During what was to be a peaceful parley session, the Americans took the unsuspecting Mangas Coloradas prisoner and then later executed him. This continued a series of incidents that fanned the flames of enmity between the encroaching Americans and the Apache. For Cochise, the Americans held nothing sacred and had violated the rules of war by capturing Mangas Coloradas during a parley session. Cochise and the Apache continued their raids against American and Mexican settlements and military positions throughout the 1860s. [PARAGRAPH:1]Following various skirmishes, Cochise and his men were gradually driven into the Dragoon Mountains but were nevertheless able to use the mountains as cover and as a base from which to continue significant skirmishes against white settlements. This was the situation until 1871 when General George Crook assumed command and used other Apaches as scouts and informants and was thereby able to force Cochise's men to surrender. Cochise was taken into custody in September of that year. The next year, the Chiricahua were ordered to Tularosa Reservation in New Mexico but refused to leave their ancestral lands in Arizona, which were guaranteed to them under treaty. Cochise managed to escape again and renewed raids and skirmishes against settlements through most of 1872. A new treaty was later negotiated by General Oliver O. Howard as the Americans relented to some of the Apaches' terms. Cochise quietly retired to an Arizona reservation, where he died of natural causes.</string>

In April 1922, a group of 200 anti-Treaty IRA men occupied the Four Courts in Dublin in defiance of the Provisional government. Collins, who wanted to avoid civil war at all costs, did not attack them until June 1922, needing to know the result of the general election which proved favourable to his party. British pressure also forced his hand. On 22 June 1922, Sir Henry Wilson, a retired British Army field marshal now serving as Military Advisor to the Craig Administration, was shot dead by two IRA men in Belgravia, London. At the time, it was presumed that the anti-Treaty faction of the IRA were responsible and Winston Churchill told Collins that unless he moved against the Four Courts garrison, he (Churchill) would use British troops to do so.[PARAGRAPH:1]In fact, it has since been proved that Collins himself ordered the killing of Wilson in reprisal for failing to prevent the attacks on Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland. Joe Dolan - a member of Collins' \"Squad\" or assassination unit in the War of Independence and in 1922 a captain in the National Army - revealed this in the 1950s, along with the revelation that Collins had ordered him to try to rescue the two gunmen before they were executed. In any event, this forced Collins to take action against the Four Courts men and the final provocation came when they kidnapped J.J. O'Connell, a provisional government general. After a final attempt to persuade the men to leave, Collins borrowed two 18 pounder artillery pieces from the British and bombarded the Four Courts until its garrison surrendered.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was shot and killed in August 1922, during the Irish Civil War. Although most Irish political parties recognise his contribution to the foundation of the modern Irish state, members and supporters of the Fine Gael political party hold his memory in particular esteem, regarding him as their movement's founding father (even though his link to them was through their precursor Cumann na nGaedhael, a name adopted in 1923 by the pro-Treaty wing of Sinn Fein).</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_COLOCOLO_PEDIA">[H1]Colocolo[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Toqui de la Paz[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] ??? - c. 1555[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Colocolo (from mapudungun \"colocolo\", mountain cat) was a Mapuche leader (\"cacique lonco\") in the early period of the Arauco War. He was a major figure in Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga's epic poem La Araucana, about the early Arauco War. In the poem he was the one that proposed the contest between the rival candidates for Toqui that resulted in the choice of Caupolicán. As a historical figure there are some few contemporary details about him. Stories of his life were written long after his lifetime and display many points of dubious historical accuracy.Pedro Mariño de Lobera listed Colocolo as one of the caciques that offered submission to Pedro de Valdivia after the Battle of Penco.  Jerónimo de Vivar in his Chronicle of the Kingdom of Chile  (1558), describes Colocolo as one of the Mapuche leaders with 6,000 warriors and one of the competitors for Toqui of the whole Mapuche army following the Battle of Tucapel. Millarapue  also a leader of 6,000 men, but old and not a candidate for the leadership, was the one who presuaded them to quit arguing among themselves and settle the matter with a contest of strength between them which resulted in the victory of Caupolicán who became Toqui.  Lobera later says Colocolo and Peteguelen were the leaders that discovered the advance of the army of Francisco de Villagra and summoned all the people who could fight from the neighboring provinces to oppose the Spanish in the battle of Battle of Marihueñu.  He was one of the commanders under Lautaro at the second destruction of Concepcion on December 4, 1555.  He also lists Colocolo as one of Caupolicán's lieutenants in the battle of Battle of Millarapue against García Hurtado de Mendoza.  Lobera also says he was one of the major leaders of the Arauco area to submit to Mendoza after the Battle of Quiapo and the reestablishment of the fortress of San Felipe de Araucan in 1559. He is also said to have given Mendoza warning of the assassination plot of Mecial.  Alonso de Góngora Marmolejo in his History of All the Things that Have happened in the Kingdom of Chile mentions Colocolo in 1561 as a principal leader in Arauco and is said to be a friend until death to the Spanish. He was consulted by Pedro de Villagra about the way to defeat the first outbreak of the second great Mapuche revolt that began that year. It says he advised them to storm a fortress the rebels had built and that such a defeat would end the rebellion.  Later, in the following year after Villagra had evacuated the city of Cañete revealing Spanish weakness, Colocolo was prevailed on by the rebellious Mapuche in Arauco to take command of their army. At his order Millalelmo laid siege to the fort of Arauco and other leaders the fort of Los Infantes.Claims are Colocolo held the position of \"Toqui de la Paz\" (Peace Chief) but took over strategic duties when Spanish conquest began, becoming the head of the native Mapuche forces against these invaders. Some others believe his death happened during the great famine and typhus epidemic in 1554-1555.</string>

He lived in the village of Ubatuba, in what is today Angra dos Reis.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cunhambebe was also the main force and elected chief of the Tamoyo Confederation, a military alliance between the sea coast tribes against the Portuguese colonists, which waged war against them until the Peace of Iperoig was celebrated with them, in 1567. The fought also the Portuguese forces in alliance with the French invaders commanded by Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon (1510-1571), a Huguenot admiral, in the historical episode which became known as the France Antarctique. According to the description of French priest André de Thevet, the German soldier of fortune and sailor Hans Staden (1525-1579) was a prisoner of Cunhambebe's father (who had the same name) between 1554 and 1557. The Tupinambá were fierce warriors and cannibals, as described by Hans Staden, who narrowly escaped several times of being killed and eaten by Cunhambebe's Indians.[PARAGRAPH:1]The war waged by the Tamoyo Confederation was strongly affecting the Portuguese colonisation efforts, so the two Portuguese Jesuit priests who had founded São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga (which became the present-day megalopolis of São Paulo), Manoel da Nóbrega (1517-1570) and José de Anchieta (1534-1597) started a peace mission by doing a high risk visit to Cunhambebe's village in Iperoig (present day Ubatuba). Although they were received with mistrust, Anchieta spoke Tupi language very well and they were spared death. Eventually, Anchieta succeeded in celebrating a peace treaty, which was respected by Cunhambebe and the Tupinambás until the attack force led by Portuguese knight D. Estácio de Sá (1520-1567) tried to expel the French invaders. In this occasion, the Tupinambá tribes came to help the Frenchmen, particularly because they felt betrayed by the Portuguese, and also because the Tupiniquim tribes, their traditional and bitter enemies, fought on the side of the Portuguese.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cunhambebe died of bubonic plague just after the arrival of Villegaigon's fleet to the Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro, so he took no part in the following events which eventually led to the almost complete destruction of the Tupinambás towards the end of the 16th century.</string>

He grew to manhood during a period of great turmoil among his people, with both the French and English bearing down upon them. Oconostota showed impressive abilities in diplomacy, and once appointed chief of the Cherokee, he managed to balance relations between his tribe and the English, French and French-allied Creek Indians. [PARAGRAPH:1]Oconostota's aid endeared the native leader to the English. When the French and Indian War began, the English requested the aid of the Cherokee, and an alliance was struck. Yet the English questioned the dedication of their Cherokee allies, who continued to have contact with the French. Whether the Cherokee were attempting to negotiate peace or to betray the English, it mattered not. Upon his return from one such talk with the French, Oconostota was captured by the English, along with numerous other Cherokee chieftains. [PARAGRAPH:1]This brazen violation of their treaty embittered relations between the Cherokee and the English. After Oconostota's release, a dispute between an English settler and a Cherokee native over a stock of horses resulted in the murder of a family of natives. This was the final straw for Oconostota, who began to exact his revenge, first with small raids against outlying English settlements, but soon with all-out war. Begun in 1758, the conflict known as the Cherokee War opened with great success for the Cherokees. Oconostota's warriors captured the English bastion of Fort Loudoun, expelling the English presence from the region and dealing a humiliating blow to the Europeans. [PARAGRAPH:1]The English response was brutally effective. Red-coated soldiers massacred over a dozen villages in the hopes of forcing Oconostota to surrender. To halt the stunning English brutality, in 1761, Oconostota agreed to a peace treaty with the English. In 1762, as a symbol of mutual good faith, Oconostota and two other Cherokee chieftains visited England and the English King George III. They drew massive crowds wherever they went in England, and so pleased was King George III with Oconostota that he promised that their lands would remain untouched. [PARAGRAPH:1]The agreement would have little effect, though, as the English colonists of the New World had no intention of following their king's instructions in this matter. Upon his return to the Americas, the chief was forced to begin his defensive efforts anew, this time as his people found themselves caught in the middle of the Revolutionary War. [PARAGRAPH:1]Oconostota continued to strive to keep his people safe from the English and these new \"Americans\" but he was unable to stem the tide of white expansion.

In early years, he became active in both the Australian Labor Party and the Victorian Socialist Party.  He also wrote for radical and socialist newspapers as \"Jack Curtin.\"  In 1911 Curtin was employed as secretary of the Timberworkers' Union, and during World War I he was an aggressive anti-conscriptist.  After he was briefly imprisoned after refusing to take a required medical test because of his poor eyesight, he began to drink heavily during the strains of this period.  After moving to Perth in 1918, his political life declined and his view became more moderated.  He stood for Parliament several times before winning in 1928, and he lost his seat after heavy drinking in 1931, but won it back in 1934.  When James Scullin resigned as Labor leader in 1935, Curtin was surprisingly nominated to succeed him.  The trade union group in the Caucus who backed him significantly made him promise to stop drinking, to which he agreed [PARAGRAPH: 1] After gaining support in 1940, Curtin was elected Prime Minister in October 1941.  On December 8, the Pacific War broke out.  Curtin made several vital choices, and in December made a statement saying that Australia supports America, not the UK.  This angered Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt said it brought panic.  The statement made some thing that Australia may possibly be invaded by Japan.  Curtin formed a close working relationship with the Allied Supreme Commander in the Southwest Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur.  Curtin realized that Australia would be disregarded unless it had a voice in Washington, and he hoped MacArthur would be that voice.  He gave control of the Australian forced to MacArthur. [PARAGRAPH: 1] After several attacks by Japan on Australian ports, it became evident that Japan might invade Australia.  Curtin also expanded the terms of the Defense Act so that other territories in the Southwest Pacific would be defended by Australia.  This brought opposition by several of Curtin's colleagues.  This was despite Curtin furiously opposing a draft during World War I, and again in 1939 when it was suggested by the Menzies government. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The stress of these quarrels took a great toll on Curtin's health, which was never vigorous.  He smoked heavily, and in 1944 had already had heart disease, and in early 1945 his health deteriorated more obviously.  In July 5, 1945, Curtin died.

Cuza received an urbane European education.  In 1848, the year of the European Revolutions, Moldovia and Wallachia fell into revolt.  In Moldavia the unrest was quickly suppressed, but in Wallachia the revolutionaries took power and governed during the summer. Young Cuza played a prominent enough part to establish his liberal credentials (compared to most nobility) and to be shipped to Vienna as a prisoner, where he soon made his escape.[NEWLINE][TAB]Afterwards however, following a brief career in the Moldavian army, he became minister of war in 1858, and represented Galati in the assembly at Iasi, acting under the guarantee of the European Powers in the wake of the Crimean war to nominate a prince for Moldavia. Cuza was a prominent speaker in the debates and strongly advocated the union of the two Danubian principalities, Moldavia and Walachia. In default of a foreign prince, he was himself elected prince of Moldavia (Moldova) on January 17, 1859 (January 5, Julian) and of Wallachia (Tara Româneasca) on February 5, 1859.[NEWLINE][TAB]Thus Colonel A. I. Cuza achieved a de facto union of the two Romanian principalites. The Powers backtracked, Napoleon III of France remaining supportive, while the Austro-Hungarian ministry withheld approval of such a union at the Congress of Paris (October 18, 1858); partly as a consequence Cuza's authority was not recognized by his nominal suzerain, the sultan of Turkey, until the December 23, 1861.[NEWLINE]The Union was formally declared three years later, on February 5, 1862 (January 24, Julian), the new country bearing the name of Romania, with Bucharest as its capital city.[NEWLINE][TAB]Cuza was not a diplomatic politician, and lacked the traditional royal background, but he knew how to choose progressive ministers and had an intelligent ear for advice. Immediately he gained the sultan's assent to a single unified parliament and cabinet for his lifetime, in recognition of the complexity of the task. Thus he was the political embodiment of a unified Romania, for his lifetime.[NEWLINE][TAB]Assisted by his councilor Mihail Kogalniceanu, an intellectual leader of the 1848 revolution, Cuza initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.The drastic reforms which he imposed to bring Romania fully into the 19th century impinged upon all classes and alienated his more influential subjects.[NEWLINE][TAB]Cuza failed in his effort to create an alliance of prosperous peasants and a strong liberal prince, ruling as a benevolent despot in the style of Napoleon III. Financial distress supervened, there was an awkward scandal that revolved around his mistress, and popular discontent culminated in revolution. Cuza was forced to abdicate by the so-called \"Monstrous Coalition\" of conservatives and radical liberals. At four o'clock on the morning of February 22, 1866, a group of military conspirators broke into the palace, and compelled the prince to sign his abdication. On the following day they conducted him safely across the frontier.Cuza spent the remainder of his life in exile, chiefly in Paris, Vienna and Wiesbaden. He died at Heidelberg on May 15, 1873.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_DAVID_IV_PEDIA">[H1]David the Builder[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Georgia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c. 1073 - 1125[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The only son of King George II (10721089) by his wife Helena, he was born in Kutaisi, western Georgia in 1073. David was raised during one of the darkest chapters of Georgian history, amidst the strife of the so-called Great Turkish Onslaught (didi turkoba) when the Seljuk  tribes began massive migrations to the southern Caucasus. King Giorgi II was unable to cope with the problem, and in a bloodless coup in 1089, he was forced to resign in favor of his 16-year-old son.  Despite his age, he was actively involved in Georgias political life. Backed by his tutor and an influential churchman George of Chqondidi, David IV pursued a purposeful policy, taking no unconsidered step. He was determined to bring order to the land, bridle the unsubmissive secular and ecclesiastic feudal lords, centralize the state administration, form a new type of army that would stand up better to the Seljuk Turkish  military organization, and then go over to a methodical offensive with the aim of expelling the Seljuks first from Georgia and then from the whole Caucasus. Between 10891100, King David organized small detachments of his loyal troops to restore order and destroy isolated enemy troops. He began the resettlement of devastated regions and helped to revive major cities. Encouraged by his success, but more importantly the beginning of the Crusades in Palestine, he ceased payment of the annual contribution to the Seljuks and put an end to their seasonal migration to Georgia. In 1101, King David captured the fortress of Zedazeni, a strategic point in his struggle for Kakheti and Hereti, and within the next three years he liberated most of eastern Georgia.  In 1093, he arrested the powerful feudal lord Liparit Baghvashi, a long-time enemy of the Georgian crown, and expelled him from Georgia (1094). After the death of Liparits son Rati, David abolished their duchy of Kldekari in 1103.  He slowly pushed the Seljuk Turks out of the country, recovering more and more land from them as they were now forced to focus not only on the Georgians but the newly begun Crusades in the eastern Mediterranean. By 1099 David IV's power was considerable enough that he was able to refuse paying tribute to the Turks. By that time, he also rejected a Byzantine title of panhypersebastos thus indicating that Georgia would deal with the Byzantine Empire only on a parity basis.  In 1103 a major ecclesiastical congress known as the Ruis-Urbnisi Synod was held at the monasteries of Ruisi and Urbnisi. David succeeded in removing oppositionist bishops, and combined two offices: courtiers (Mtzignobartukhutsesi, i.e. Chief Secretary) and clerical (Bishop of Tchqondidi) into a single institution of Tchqondidel-Mtzignobartukhutsesi corresponding roughly to the post of prime minister.  Next year, Davids supporters in the eastern Georgian province of Kakheti captured the local king Aghsartan II (11021104), a loyal tributary of the Seljuk Sultan, and reunited the area with the rest of Georgia.Following the annexation of Kakheti, in 1105, David routed a Seljuk punitive force at the Battle of Ertzukhi, leading to momentum that helped him to secure the key fortresses of Samshvilde, Rustavi, Gishi, and Lorri between 1110 and 1118.  Problems began to crop up for David now. His population, having been at war for the better part of twenty years, needed to be allowed to become productive again. Also, his nobles were still making problems for him, along with the city of Tbilisi which still could not be liberated from Arab grasp. Again David was forced to solve these problems before he could continue the reclamation of his nation and people. For this purpose, David IV radically reformed his military. He resettled a Kipchak tribe of 14.000 families from the Northern Caucasus in Georgia in 11181120. Every Georgian and Kipchak family was obliged to provide one soldier with a horse and weapons. This 56.000 men strong army was entirely dependent on the King. Kipchaks were settled in different regions of Georgia. Some were settled in Inner Kartli province, others were given lands along the border. They were quickly assimilated into Georgian society.  In 1120 David IV moved to western Georgia and, when the Turks began pillaging Georgian lands, he suddenly attacked them. Only an insignificant Seljuk force escaped. King David then entered the neighbouring Shirvan and took the town of Qabala.  In the winter of 11201121 the Georgian troops successfully attacked the Seljuk settlements on the eastern and southwestern approaches to the Transcaucasus.  Muslim powers became increasingly concerned about the rapid rise of a Christian state in southern Caucasia. In 1121, Sultan Mahmud b. Muhammad (11181131) declared a holy war on Georgia and rallied a large coalition of Muslim states led by the Artuqid Najm al-din El-gazi and Togrul b. Muhammad. The size of the Muslim army is still a matter of debate with numbers ranging from fantastic 600,000 men (Walter the Chancellors Bella Antiochena, Matthew of Edessa) to 400,000 (Smbat Sparapets Chronicle) to modern Georgian estimates of 250,000400,000 men. All sources agree that the Muslim powers gathered an army that was far much larger than the Georgian force of 56,000 men. However, August 12, 1121, King David routed the enemy army on the fields of Didgori, achieving what is often considered the greatest military success in Georgian history. The victory at Didgori signaled the emergence of Georgia as a great military power and shifted the regional balance in favor of Georgian cultural and political supremacy.  David the Builder died on January 24, 1125, and upon his death, King David was, as he had ordered, buried under the stone inside the main gatehouse of the Gelati Monastery so that anyone coming to his beloved Gelati Academy stepped on his tomb first, a humble gesture for a great man. He had three children, the son Demetre, who succeeded him and continued his father's victorious reign; and two daughters, Tamar, who was married to the Shirwan Shah Akhsitan (Aghsartan in Georgian), and Kata (Katai), married to Isaakios Comnenus, the son of the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus. Beside his political and military skills, King David earned fame as a writer, composing Galobani sinanulisani (Hymns of Repentance, c. 1120), a powerful work of emotional free-verse psalms, which reveal the kings humility and religious zeal.</string>

David became a popular hero, and because of this, the Judeans made him king of their tribe.  After King Saul and his son died in battle, David became king of Israel.  David's main goal was to unite the tribes of Israel into one kingdom.  There were many wars against the surrounding nations, and David proved to be a very good military leader. [PARAGRAPH:1] To bind the tribes closer together, David established on capital.  David conquered Jerusalem, to which he brought the ark of the law.  The ark contained two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written.  King David was not only known for his military might, but his religious closeness to God.  David suffered many disappointments, but through it all, he remained a powerful leader. [PARAGRAPH:1] King David wrote many religious poems, or psalms, that are today included in many synogogues and churches.  David helped arrange services that would later be used in the temple build by his son, Solomon.  King David was so loved and admired, that some thought of him as the messiah.</string>

The situation continued until Diurpaneus managed to consolidate the core of Dacia around Sarmizegetusa, in today's Hunedoara county. He reorganized the Dacian army and in 85 the Dacians began raiding the heavily fortified Roman province of Moesia, located south of the Danube.[NEWLINE][TAB]In 87, Domitian decided to send his prefect of the Praetorian Guards, Cornelius Fuscus, to punish and conquer the Dacians with five or four legions. Two Roman legions (among which V Alaudae) were ambushed and defeated at Tapae (near modern Bucova), and Fuscus killed. Diurpaneus changed his name into Decebalus.[NEWLINE][TAB]In 88, Tettius Iulianus commanded another Roman army in a campaign against the Dacians, who were defeated at the battle of Tapae; revolts of the Germans on the Rhine required the military force of Moesia, and the Romans were forced to pay large sums of money in the form of tribute to the Dacians for maintaining peace in this region. The humiliating situation for the Romans lasted until Trajan acceded as Emperor of the Roman Empire in 98.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_DEMETRIUS_PEDIA">[H1]Demetrius I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Greco-Bactrian/ Indo-Greek King[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ruled: [\BOLD] c. 200 BC - 180 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Demetrius I was a Buddhist Greco-Bactrian king (reigned circa 200-180 BC). He was the son of Euthydemus and succeeded him around 200 BC, after which he conquered extensive areas in what now is eastern Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan thus creating an Indo-Greek kingdom far from Hellenistic Greece. He was never defeated in battle and was posthumously qualified as the Invincible (Aniketos) on the pedigree coins of his successor Agathocles.  The father of Demetrius, Euthydemus, was attacked by the Seleucid ruler Antiochus III around 210 BC. Although he commanded 10,000 horsemen, Euthydemus initially lost a battle on the Arius and had to retreat. He then successfully resisted a three-year siege in the fortified city of Bactra, before Antiochus finally decided to recognize the new ruler.  The final negotiations were made between Antiochus III and Demetrius. Antiochus III was reportedly highly impressed by the demeanor of the young prince, and offered him one of his daughters in marriage, around 206 BC.Demetrius started the invasion of northwestern India from 180 BC, following the destruction of the Mauryan dynasty by the general Pusyamitra Sunga, who then founded the new Indian Sunga dynasty (185-78 BC). The Mauryans had had diplomatic alliances with the Greeks, and they may have been considered as allies by the Greco-Bactrians.  The Greco-Bactrians may also have invaded India in order to protect Greek populations in the subcontinent.  Demetrius may have first started to recover the province of Arachosia, an area south of the Hindu Kush already inhabited by many Greek but ruled by the Mauryas since the liberation of the territory by Chandragupta from Seleucus. In his \"Parthian stations\", Isidorus of Charax mentions a colony named Demetrias, supposedly founded by Demetrius himself.  It is generally considered that Demetrius ruled in Taxila (where many of his coins were found in the archaeological site of Sirkap). The Indian records also describes Greek attacks on Saketa, Panchala, Mathura and Pataliputra (Gargi-Samhita, Yuga Purana chapter). However, the campaigns to Pataliputra are generally attested to the later king Menander I and Demetrius I probably only invaded areas in Pakistan. Other kings may have expanded the territory as well.  By ca 175 BC, the Indo-Greeks ruled parts northwestern India, while the Sungas remained in the Gangetic, Central, and Eastern India. The Indo Greek presence in the Northwest continued until the last petty principality was absorbed by the Sakas around 20 BC.  The Hathigumpha inscription, written by the king of Kalinga, Kharavela, has been interpreted to describe the presence of the Greek king \"Demetrius\" with his army in eastern India, possibly as far as the city of Rajagriha about 70 km southeast of Pataliputra and one of the foremost Buddhist sacred cities, but claims that Demetrius ultimately retreated to Mathura on hearing of Kharavela's military successes further south.Demetrius I died of unknown reasons, and the date 180 BC, is merely a suggestion aimed to allow suitable regnal periods for subsequent kings, of which there were several. Even if some of them were co-regents, civil wars and temporary divisions of the empire are most likely.  The kings Pantaleon, Antimachus, Agathocles and possibly Euthydemus II ruled after Demetrius I, and theories about their origin include all of them being relatives of Demetrius I, or only Antimachus. Eventually, the kingdom of Bactria fell to the able newcomer Eucratides.  Demetrius II was a later king, possibly a son or nephew of his namesake, and he ruled in India only. Justin mentions him being defeated by the Bactrian king Eucratides, an event which took place at the end of the latter's reign, possibly around 150 BC. Demetrius II left behind his generals Apollodotus and Menander I, who in turn became kings of India and rulers of the Indo-Greek Kingdom following his death.</string>

Donnacona and his people were fishing off the Gaspé peninsula when French explorer Jacques Cartier first arrived there in 1534. Cartier persuaded him to let his two sons, Domagaya and Taignoagny, sail away with him, promising to bring them back. The French needed to train interpreters. They spent eight months there and sailed again with Cartier in May 1535. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cartier obtained from Donnacona, who claimed to have travelled a great deal, much information about the country and also about the fabulous kingdom of the Saguenay which could be reached by the river which bears that name today and where \"there are immense quantities of gold, rubies and other rich things, and . . . the men there are white as in France and go clothed in woolens,\" along with many other \"marvels too long to relate.\" [PARAGRAPH:1]A mutual distrust flared up in the spring of 1536. Donnacona absented himself mysteriously and returned with people who had never been seen before. Cartier sent him an embassy, but Donnacona refused to receive it. It was finally learned that a quarrel had broken out at Stadacona between Chief Donnacona and his rival Agona. The interpreter Taignoagny asked for Cartier's help to eliminate Agona. Cartier saw how he could turn the situation to good account and was \"determined to outwit them.\" Since there was a crisis at Stadacona, it was better to get rid of Donnacona and his sons who were hindering the policy of the French. Cartier pretended therefore to join in the plot against Agona. The interpreters promised to come back the following day for the feast of the Holy Cross. Donnacona and his people arrived for the religious ceremony and were seized on an order from Cartier. [PARAGRAPH:1]Upon their arrival in France in July 1536, Chief Donnacona and his companions proceeded to live at the king's expense. Donnacona was presented to François I, and talked to him about mines which were very rich in gold and silver, of an abundance of cloves, nutmeg, and pepper (the spices of which Europe dreamed). He enumerated many marvels, such as men with wings on their arms like bats, who flew from the trees to the ground. Around 1539, Donnacona died. When Cartier returned in 1541, a  veritable war finally broke out between the natives of Stadacona and the colonists at Charlesbourg-Royal. The St. Lawrence Iroquois were to boast of killing more than 35 of Cartier's men in avenging Donnacona.</string>

He served under Napoleon I and led the Swiss forces to victory against the Sonderbund.  He presided over the First Geneva Convention which established the international Red Cross.  He was the most famous president of the Swiss Federal Office of Topography from 1838 to 1865.  The Dufourspitze (the highest mountain in Switzerland) in Monte Rosa Massif is named for him.  Dufour's father Benedict was a Genevan watchmaker and farmer, who sent his son to school in Geneva, where he studied drawing and medicine.  In 1807, Dufour travelled to Paris to join the Ecole Polytechnique, then a military academy.  He studied descriptive geometry under Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette, and graduated in 1809, going on to study study military engineering at the Ecole d'Application.  In 1810, he was sent to help defend Corfu against the British, and spent his time mapping the island's old fortifications.  By 1814, he had returned to France and was awarded the Croix de la Legion d'Honneur for his work repairing fortifications at Lyons.  In 1817, he returned to Geneva to become the commander of the Canton of Geneva's military engineers, as well as professor of mathematics at the University of Geneva, his duties included preparing a map of the Canton.

He spent several years in Constantinople as a child, learning the culture and languages of Byzantium.  As a young soldier, he preformed exceptionally well in two battles, one in 1329 and another in 1330. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Because his father had not made an effort to expand Serbia, Dusan rebelled with the help of the nobles and crowned himself king in 1331.  In 1332, he married Helena of Bulgaria, who had a large influence on Dusan.  In the first years of his reign, Dusan fought against the Byzantine Empire.  He also found himself involved in large disagreements with the Hungarians.  However, these battles were primarily defensive and both times resulted in victory for the Serbs.  During this time, he received help from the Bulgarians, whom were allies of Serbia at the time. [PARAGRAPH: 1] At the time, a civil war occupied Byzantium and Dusan took advantage of this.  He extended Serbian territory into the western Balkans, his goal being to conquer Constantinople and replace the weakening Byzantine Empire with a Greco-Serbian Empire under his control.  After these successes, he proclaimed himself as \"Emperor and Autocrat of Serbs and Greeks\" in 1346.  He received help from the Serbian Orthodox Church to establish his power, which he had expanded in previous years. [PARAGRAPH: 1] With the increasing Serbian threat, the Byzantines found allies in the Turks.  The Turks had only recently entered the European scene, and the first conflict between the Serbs and Turks ended in defeat for Dusan.  In 1348 Dusan further expanded Serbian territory by conquering the regions of Thessaly and Epirus.  Dusan at this time saw the threat of the Turks and sought ways to delay their expansion.  However, he was disrupted by the Hungarians, who harassed Serbia.  He heavily defeated the Hungarians and their king.  Dusan's ambitions were cut short by his premature death in 1355, possibly resulting from poisoning by the Hungarians.  He was succeeded by his son, Stefan Uros V, who had been in power as king since 1346.  In addition to expanding Serbian territory significantly, Dusan made and enforced a new code of laws, known as Dusan's Code, in the years 1349 and 1354.</string>

In 1964 he made himself President for Life. He ruled until his death in 1971, in a regime marked by autocracy, corruption, and state-sponsored terrorism through his private militia known as Tonton Macoutes. He was estimated to have caused the deaths of 30,000 and exile of thousands more. Born in Port-au-Prince, Duvalier was the son of Duval Duvalier, a justice of the peace, and Ulyssia Abraham, a mentally unstable woman who worked in a bakery. She lived in an asylum until she died in 1921. Largely raised by an aunt, Duvalier completed a degree in medicine from the University of Haiti in 1934.[PARAGRAPH:1]Through an election viewed as rigged by the Army (FADH), Duvalier won the presidency in September, 1957.His opponent was Louis Dejoie, a mullato industrialist from the North of Haiti who had dozens of farms and a some factories.He described Louis Dejoie as part of the ruling mullato class that was making life difficult for the country's rural black majority. He had campaigned as a populist leader, using a noiriste strategy of challenging the mulatto elite, who had created a class structure that divided the country, and appealing to the Afro-Haitian majority.He exiled most of the major supporters of Louis Dejois once he had become president. After being sworn in on October 22, 1957, Duvalier revived the traditions of vodou. Later he used them to consolidate his power as he claimed to be a houngan, or vodou priest himself.[PARAGRAPH:1]Duvalier deliberately modeled his image on that of Baron Samedi in an effort to make himself even more imposing. He often donned sunglasses to hide his eyes and talked with the strong nasal tone associated with the loa. Duvalier regime propaganda candidly stated that \"Papa Doc: was one with the loas, Jesus Christ, and God himself. The most celebrated image from the time shows a standing Jesus Christ with hand on a seated Papa Doc's shoulder with the caption \"I have chosen him\".[PARAGRAPH:1]After surviving an attempted coup in mid-1958, Duvalier curtailed the power of the army through a rural militia, the Milice Volontaires de la Sécurité Nationale. Commonly referred to as the Tonton Macoutes, which derived from the Creole term for a fabled bogeyman, they were patterned after the paramilitary blackshirts of Fascist Italy. The Macoutes had no official salary and made their living through crime and extortion. By 1961 the Tonton Macoutes had more power than the army. Extraordinarily loyal to Duvalier, the group terrorized, tortured, and murdered those who seemed in any way to oppose the Duvalier regime. These threats were often aimed at social aid or community organizations without explicit political affiliations. The Tonton Macoutes' influence throughout the country created and bolstered support for and loyalty to Duvalier and later his son[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition to his pervasive control over Haitian life, Duvalier also fostered an extensive personality cult around himself, and claimed to be the physical embodiment of the island nation. Within the country, Duvalier used both political murder and expulsion to suppress his opponents; estimates of those killed are as high as 30,000. Attacks on Duvalier from within the military were treated as especially serious; in 1967 the fact that bombs were detonated near the Presidential Palace led to his execution of twenty Presidential Guard officers. Such tactics kept the country in Duvalier's grip until his death in early 1971. His 19-year-old son Jean-Claude Duvalier followed him as president</string>

She was the first known holder of the title, 'En Priestess', a role of great political importance which often was held by royal daughters.Regarded by literary and historical scholars as the earliest known author and poet, she served as an En Priestess during the Third Millennium BC. She was appointed to the role by her Father, Sargon of Akkad. She has left behind a corpus of literary works definitively ascribed to her, including many personal devotions to the goddess Inanna and a collection of Hymns known as the 'Sumerian Temple Hymns' which are regarded as one of the first attempts at a systematic theology. In addition scholars , such as Hallo and Van Dijk, suggest that certain texts which have not been ascribed to her may also be her work.  Enheduanna was appointed to the role of En Priestess at Ur by her Father King Sargon of Akkad, in a move considered to be a shrewd political move by the Akkadian Sargon to help cement power in the Sumerian south, in which the City of Ur was located. She continued to hold office during the reign of Rimush her brother. It was during the reign of Rimush that she was involved in some form of political turmoil and expelled from the role and eventually reinstated. This is detailed in her composition 'The Exaltation of Inanna\" details her expulsion from Ur and eventual reinstatement.  This correlates with with 'The Curse of Akkade' in which Naram-Sin, under whom Enheduanna may have also served, is cursed and cast out by Enlil. After her death Enheduanna continued to be remembered as an important figure, perhaps even attaining semi-divine status.</string>

He was at least in his seventies when he became Doge. Some accounts say he was already 85 years old when he became Doge. His remarkable deeds over the next eleven years bring that age into question, however. Others have hypothesized that he may have been in his mid-70s when he became Venice's leader.In 1202 the knights of the Fourth Crusade were stranded in Venice, unable to pay for the ships they had commissioned after far fewer troops arrived than expected due to internal sabotage of the operation by the Venetians. Dandolo developed a plan that allowed the Crusaders' debt to be suspended if they assisted the Venetians in restoring nearby Zara to Venetian control. At an emotional and rousing ceremony in Piazza di San Marco in Venezia, Dandolo \"took the cross\" (committed himself to crusading) and was soon joined by thousands of other Venetians. Dandolo became an important leader of the crusade.[PARAGRAPH:1]Venice was the major financial backer of the Fourth Crusade, supplied the Crusaders' ships, and lent money to the Crusaders who became heavily indebted to Venice. Because of the crusaders' continued delays, provisions were also a problem for the enterprise.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although they were supposed to be sailing to Egypt, Dandolo convinced them to stop at Zara, a port city on the Adriatic that was claimed both by Venice and by the Kingdom of Hungary. Dandolo encouraged the crusaders to attack the city which had rebelled from Venice. A small number of Crusaders refused to help; but the others realized that the conquest of the rebel town and subsequent wintering there was the only way to hold the faltering crusade together. Zara was besieged and captured on November 15, 1202.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shortly afterwards, Alexius Angelus, son of the deposed Byzantine emperor Isaac II, arrived in that city. Dandolo agreed to go along with crusade leaders plan to place Alexius Angelus on the throne of the Byzantine Empire in return for Byzantine support of the crusade. This ultimately led to the conquest and sack of Constantinople on April 13, 1204, an event at which Dandolo was present and in which he played a directing role. The Catholic Crusaders then took permanent control of the Eastern Orthodox capital of Constantinople (or Byzantium) and established a Catholic state, the Latin Empire. Venice gained title to three-eighths of the Byzantine Empire as a result of the 4th Crusade. The Byzantine Empire was never again as powerful as it had been prior to the Fourth Crusade.</string>

The king Eucratides dethroned in Bactria was probably Antimachus I.  It is unclear whether Eucratides was a Bactrian official who raised a rebellion, or, according to some scholars, a cousin of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes who was trying to regain the Bactrian territory. Justin explains that Eucratides acceeded to the throne at about the same time as Mithridates, whose rule is accurately known to have started in 171 BCE, thereby giving an approximate date for the accession of Eucratides.  Having become master of Bactria, Eucratides also conquered the western parts of the Indo-Greek kingdom. According to the single remaining source, Roman historian Justin, Eucratides defeated Demetrius of India, but the identity of this king is uncertain: he could be either Demetrius I, or Demetrius II.  Numismatic evidence suggests that Eucratides I was a contemporary of the Indo-Greek kings Apollodotus I, Antimachus II and Menander I. In any case, Eucratides' advances into India are proved by his abundant bilingual coinage.  In the west the Parthian king Mithradates I began to enlarge his kingdom and attacked Eucratides; the city of Herat fell in 167 BC and the Parthians succeeded in conquering two provinces between Bactria and Parthia, called by Strabo the country of Aspiones and Turiua.Justin ends his account of Eucratides' life by claiming that the warlike king was murdered on his way back from India by his own son (either Eucratides II or Heliocles I, although there are speculations that it could be his enemy's son Demetrius II), who hated his father so much that he dragged his dead body after his chariot.  The murder of Eucratides probably brought about a civil war amongst the members of the dynasty. The successors to Eucratides were Eucratides II and Heliocles I (145130 BCE), who was the last Greek king to reign in Bactria. Once the Yuezhi tribes overpowered Heliocles, the Greco-Bactrians lost control of the provinces north of the Hindu Kush.  However, the rule of the Indo-Greeks  over territories south of the Hindu Kush lasted for a further 150 years, ultimately collapsing under the pressure of the Yüeh-chih and Scythian (Saka) invasions in around 10 BCE.</string>

He grew up in Istanbul and learned about leadership from his father. In 1913, he was elected as representative for the city of Jeddah for the Ottoman parliament.  In 1916, on a mission to Istanbul, he visited Damascus twice. On one of these visits he received the Damascus Protocol, joined with the Al-Fatat group of Arab nationalists, and his father became king of Hejaz.On 23 October, 1916 at Hamra in the Wadi Safra, the first encounter took place between Feisal and Captain T. E. Lawrence, a relatively junior British intelligence officer from Cairo. Lawrence already had a vision of an independent, post-war Arabian state and knew it was essential to find precisely the right man to lead the Arab forces to achieve this.  With the help of Lawrence, Faisal sided with the British army and organised the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire helping to end the Caliphate. After a long siege he conquered Medina, defeating the defense organized by Fakhri Pasha.  Some of Faisal's critics considered fighting alongside Christians as a betrayal to Islam. This motivated Iqbal to write against him. Though Faisal was a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Arab nationalism and independence, not religion, was his main motivation.  Faisal also worked with the Allies during World War I in their conquest of Greater Syria and the capture of Damascus, where he became part of a new Arab government in 1918.On 7 March 1920, Faisal was proclaimed King of Greater Syria by the Syrian National Congress government of Hashim al-Atassi. In April 1920, the San Remo conference gave France the mandate for Syria, which led to the Franco-Syrian War. In the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920, the French were victorious and Faisal was expelled from Syria. He went to live in the United Kingdom in August of that year.  In March 1921, at the Cairo Conference, the British decided that Faisal was a good candidate for ruling the British Mandate of Iraq. But, in 1921, few people living in Iraq even knew who Faisal was or had ever heard his name. Though he was not popular there was a lack of organized opposition so he could remain ruler and establish power.  The British government, mandate holders in Iraq, were concerned at the unrest in the colony. They decided to step back from direct administration and create a monarchy to head Iraq while they maintained the mandate. Following a plebiscite showing 96% in favor, which was not really accurate, but created by a British council of ministers who wanted to put Faisal in power, Faisal agreed to become king. In August 1921 he was made king of Iraq.  Faisal saw the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 as an obstacle to his pan-Arab agenda, although it provided Iraq with a degree of political independence. He wanted to make sure that the treaty had a built-in end date because the treaty further divided Syria and Iraq, the former which was under French control, and the latter under British rule. This prevented unity between two major Arab regions, which were important in Faisals pan-Arab agenda. Ironically, Arab nationalists in Iraq had a positive reception to the treaty because they saw this as progress, which seemed better than the Arab situation in Syria and Palestine.In August 1933, incidents like the Simele massacre caused tension between the United Kingdom and Iraq. Prime Minister Ramsay McDonald ordered High Commissioner Francis Humphrys to Iraq immediately upon hearing of the killing of Assyrian Christians. The British government demanded that Faisal stay in Bagdad to punish the guilty  whether Christian or Mohammedan. In response, Faisal cabled to the Iraqi Legation in London: \"Although everything is normal now in Iraq, and in spite of my broken health, I shall await the arrival of Sir Francis Humphrys in Bagdad, but there is no reason for further anxiety. Inform the British Government of the contents of my telegram.\"  In July 1933, right before his death, Faisal went to London where he expressed his alarm at the current situation of Arabs that resulted from the Arab-Jewish conflict and the increased Jewish immigration to Palestine, as the Arab political, social, and economic situation was declining. He asked the British to limit Jewish migration and land sales, for fear that otherwise in the near future the Arabs would either be squeezed out of Palestine or reduced to economic and social servitude.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_FRANZ_PEDIA">[H1]Franz Josef[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of Austria[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1930 - 1916[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Francis Joseph I (in German often abbreviated Franz Joseph or Franz Josef, and in English also Francis Joseph) of the Habsburg Dynasty was Emperor of Austria and King of Bohemia from 1848 until 1916, and Apostolic King of Hungary from 1867 until 1916. He was born in Vienna, Austria. His 68 years on the throne makes him one of the longest-serving monarchs in European history, and while his heir Karl took over for two years upon his death in 1916, Franz Joseph is clearly the last of the great Habsburg monarchs.[PARAGRAPH:1]Archduke Franz was the oldest son of Archduke Franz Karl, who was brother and heir of Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I, and his wife Sophie, Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Bavaria). Franz was also the older brother of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. Because his father renounced his claim to the throne, Franz was brought up by his mother as a future Emperor with emphasis on devoutness, responsibility and diligence. His youth was marked with seclusion and he never got approximated even with his brothers and sisters. At the age of 13 he started a career as a colonel in Austrian army. Since then his fashion was dictated by army style and he wore the uniform for most of his life.[PARAGRAPH:1]He became Austrian Emperor as Franz Joseph I when Ferdinand abdicated near the end of the Revolution of 1848, on December 2, 1848. His imperial career was at first connected with the personality of Felix Schwarzenberg and was targeted to restore absolutism and regain the powerful position in foreign affairs. He abolished the Constitution of 1849 and became a sovereign monarch in 1852. However, the 1850s witnessed several failures of Austrian external policy (Crimean War and breaking-up with Russia, Austro-Sardinian War of 1859 against armies of the House of Savoy and Napoleon III).[PARAGRAPH:1]The set-backs continued in the 1860s with Austro-Prussian War of 1866. It resulted in Austrian-Hungarian Dualism in 1867.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1854 Franz Joseph married Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria (also Princess of Bavaria through her mother's side of the family), who became Elisabeth of Austria (\"Sisi\" or \"Sissi\"). Their only son, Crown Prince Rudolf, committed suicide in 1889 in the (in)famous Mayerling episode with his young mistress Baroness Mary Vetsera. Rudolf's killing of the Baroness Vetsera was an extremely grim chapter in the long line of outbreaks of mental instability in the Habsburg Dynasty caused by their long history of inbreeding. The younger brother to Emperor Franz Joseph, the Archduke Viktor Ludwig, spent most of his life exiled on the island of Capri, following a series of scandals involving dressing up in women's clothes and molesting his military aides.[PARAGRAPH:1]Notwithstanding the scandals, there were times when Franz Joseph took firm moral stands. When Pope Pius IX detained the six-year-old Jewish boy Edgardo Mortara on account of the claim that a housekeeper had secretly baptized him, Emperor Franz Joseph sent the Pope a plea to return the child to his parents. The Pope refused his request.[PARAGRAPH:1]When World War I erupted, Austria-Hungary fought in alliance with Germany, but the Austro-Hungarian Army proved ill-prepared and ill-equipped. Franz Joseph's conservatism was partly to blame: when presented with the suggestion that the army should acquire a newly-developed mechanical weapon, namely tanks, he famously retorted: \"Absolutely not. The horses will be startled!\".[PARAGRAPH:1]Their three other children were Archduchess Sophie of Austria (1855 - 1858), Archduchess Gisela of Austria (1856 - 1932) and Archduchess Marie-Valerie of Austria (1868 - 1924).[PARAGRAPH:1]The archipelago Franz Josef Land in the Russian high arctic was named in his honor in 1873. Franz Josef Glacier in New Zealand's South Island also bears his name.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_FSFORZA_PEDIA">[H1]Francesco I Sforza[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Duke of Milan[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1401 - 1466[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Francesco Sforza was born in San Miniato, Tuscany, one of the seven illegitimate sons of the condottiero Muzio Sforza and Lucia da Torsano. He spent his childhood in Tricarico (in the modern Basilicata), the marquisate of which he was granted in 1412 by King Ladislas of Naples. In 1418, he married Polissena Ruffo, a Calabrese noblewoman.  From 1419, he fought alongside his father, soon gaining fame for being able to bend metal bars with his bare hands. He later proved himself to be an expert tactician and very skilled field commander. After the death of his father, he fought initially for the Neapolitan army and then for Pope Martin V and the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti. After some successes, he fell in disgrace and was sent to the castle of Mortara as a prisoner de facto. He regained his status after a successful expedition against Lucca.  In 1431, after a period during which he fought again for the Papal States, he led the Milanese army against Venice; the following year the duke's daughter, Bianca Maria, was betrothed to him. Despite these moves, the wary Filippo Maria never ceased to be distrustful of Sforza. The allegiance of mercenary leaders was dependent, of course, on pay; in 1433-1435, Sforza led the Milanese attack on the Papal States, but when he conquered Ancona, in the Marche, he changed sides, obtaining the title of vicar of the city directly from Pope Eugene IV. In 1436-39, he served variously both Florence and Venice.  In 1440, his fiefs in the Kingdom of Naples were occupied by King Alfonso I, and, to recover the situation, Sforza reconciled himself with Filippo Visconti. On October 25, 1441, in Cremona, he could finally marry Bianca Maria. The following year, he allied with René of Anjou, pretender to the throne of Naples, and marched against southern Italy. After some initial drawbacks, he defeated the Neapolitan commander Niccolò Piccinino, who had invaded his possessions in Romagna and Marche, through the help of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta (who had married his daughter Polissena) and the Venetians, and could return to Milan.  Sforza later found himself warring against his son Francesco (whom he defeated at the Battle of Montolmo in 1444) and, later, the alliance of Visconti, Eugene IV, and Sigismondo Malatesta, who had allegedly murdered Polissena. With the help of Venice, Sforza was again victorious and, in exchange for abandoning the Venetians, received the title of capitano generale (commander-in-chief) of the Duchy of Milan's armies.After the duke died without a male heir in 1447, fighting broke out to restore the so-called Ambrosian Republic.  The name Ambrosian Republic takes its name from St. Ambrose, a popular patron saint of Milan.  Sforza received the seigniory of several cities of the duchy, including Pavia and Lodi, and started to carefully plan the conquest of the ephemeral republic, allying with William VIII of Montferrat  and (again) Venice. In 1450, after years of famine, riots raged in the streets of Milan and the city's senate decided to entrust to him the dukedom. It was the first time that such a title was handed over by a lay institution. While the other Italian states gradually recognized Sforza as the legitimate Duke of Milan, he was never able to obtain official investiture from the Holy Roman Emperor. That did not come to the Sforza Dukes until 1494, when Emperor Maximilian formally invested Francesco's son, Lodovico (also known as Ludovico Sforza), as Duke of Milan.  Under his rule (which was moderate and skillful), Sforza modernised the city and duchy. He created an efficient system of taxation that generated enormous revenues for the government, his court became a center of Renaissance learning and culture, and the people of Milan grew to love him. In Milan, he founded the Ospedale Maggiore, restored the Palazzo dell'Arengo, and had the Naviglio d'Adda, a channel connecting with the Adda River, built.  During Sforza's reign, Florence was under the command of Cosimo de' Medici and the two rulers became close friends. This friendship eventually manifested in first the Peace of Lodi and then the Italian League, a multi-polar defensive alliance of Italian states that succeeded in stabilising almost all of Italy for its duration. After the peace, Sforza renounced part of the conquests in eastern Lombardy obtained by his condottieri Bartolomeo Colleoni, Ludovico Gonzaga, and Roberto Sanseverino after 1451. As King Alfonso of Naples was among the signatories of the treaty, Sforza also abandoned his long support of the Angevin pretenders to Naples. He also aimed to conquer Genoa, then an Angevin possession; when a revolt broke out there in 1461, he had Spinetta Campofregoso elected as Doge, as his puppet. Sforza occupied Genoa and Savona until 1464.  Sforza was the first European ruler to follow a foreign policy based on the concept of the balance of power, and the first native Italian ruler to conduct extensive diplomacy outside the peninsula to counter the power of threatening states such as France. Sforza's policies succeeded in keeping foreign powers from dominating Italian politics for the rest of the century.  Sforza suffered from hydropsy and gout. In 1462, rumours spread that he was dead and a riot exploded in Milan. He however survived for four more years, finally dying in March 1466. He was succeeded as duke by his son, Galeazzo Maria Sforza. A clay model of the horse for equestrian statue to Francesco I Sforza was completed by Leonardo Da Vinci in Milan 1492but the statue was never built; it was cast as a equine statue and placed in Milan outside the racetrack of Ippodromo del Galoppo in 1992.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_GAJAH_MADA_PEDIA">[H1]Gajah Mada[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Majapahit Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c.1300 - 1364 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]No information is available on his early life, except that he was born a commoner. He rose to power on his intelligence, courage, and loyalty to King Jayanagara (1309-28) during a rebellion led by Kuti in 1319. He served as the head of the royal bodyguard that escorted King Jayanagara to Badander, when Kuti captured the capital of Majapahit. After finding a safe place for the King, he returned to the capital and spread the rumour that the King had been killed. He discovered that many officers were upset by the King's supposed death and that Kuti was apparently unpopular among the people. Knowing, therefore, that the King still had loyal followers, Gajah Mada secretly organized a counterinsurrection, in which Kuti was killed and the King was restored. As a reward, Gajah Mada was appointed as the patih (minister) of Daha and, later, the patih of Daha and Janggala, a position that made him a member of the ruling elite. Prapanca, a court poet and historian, described Gajah Mada as \"eloquent, sharp of speech, upright, and sober-minded\".[PARAGRAPH:1]Gajah Mada's loyalty to Jayanagara waned, however, when the King took possession of his wife. In 1328, when Jayanagara was ill, Gajah Mada instructed Tancha, the court physician, to kill the King during an operation. Upon the death of the King, Tancha was blamed and executed by Gajah Mada. Since the King had no son, his daughter Tribhuvana became ruler.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the reign of Tribhuvana (1328-50), Gajah Mada gradually became the most powerful figure in Majapahit. In 1331 a rebellion took place in Sadeng (eastern Java). Gajah Mada immediately sent a military expedition to the area, but a minister of Majapahit named Kembar attempted to stop him from entering Sadeng. Gajah Mada broke the blockade and won the battle.[PARAGRAPH:1]Upon his return, Gajah Mada was appointed as mapatih, or prime minister, of Majapahit. At the same time, he took a solemn oath before the council of ministers that he would not enjoy palapa (privileges of vacation or the revenue from his fief ) before he conquered the whole archipelago for Majapahit. When Kembar and other ministers ridiculed this fantastic boast, Gajah Mada, with the help of the Queen, removed Kembar and his followers from office. In 1343, in accordance with his plans, Gajah Mada led a military expedition that conquered Bali.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tribhuvana abdicated in 1350 and was succeeded by her son Hayam Wuruk, perhaps the best known king of Majapahit. During his reign, Majapahit reached the zenith of its power and controlled the whole of the Indonesian archipelago. The young King seemed content to leave the direction of affairs entirely in the hands of his prime minister.[PARAGRAPH:1]The year after Hayam Wuruk's accession, Gajah Mada attempted to spread Majapahit influence to the western Java kingdom of Sunda. He sent a mission to Sunda expressing the wish of Hayam Wuruk to marry the daughter of the King of Sunda. The King consented and brought the Princess, together with some of his noblemen, to Majapahit. They camped in Bubat, north of the capital, in a large field where the wedding was supposed to take place. A disagreement ensued between Gajah Mada and the Sundanese king. The former wanted the King to surrender the Princess to Hayam Wuruk, but the King and his noblemen insisted that the Princess, as the queen of Majapahit, should have a status equal to that of Hayam Wuruk.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gajah Mada brought in troops and intended to decide the issue by force. The Sundanese noblemen preferred death to dishonour; instead of a happy wedding, a bloody massacre took place. The King of Sunda was killed, as were the Princess and the Sundanese noblemen. After the massacre, Sunda seems to have acknowledged the overlordship of Majapahit for a time but, ultimately, recovered its independence.[PARAGRAPH:1]To glorify his power, Gajah Mada built a temple on the boundary line of the Singhasari kingdom in eastern Java to equate himself with the last king of Singhasari. It was under his patronage that Prapanca began the composition of Nagarakertagama, the epic of Majapahit. A law book that had a great significance in Javanese history was also compiled under his instructions.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gajah Mada also played a major role in the direction of internal policy. He occupied numerous positions, including that of chief officer of the palace. The range of his activities was so great that, when he died, Hayam Wuruk found it necessary to appoint four ministers to take over the positions that had previously been the responsibility of Gajah Mada alone. Gajah Mada's death (1364) occurred under mysterious circumstances. Some writers claim that he was poisoned by Hayam Wuruk, who had come to fear his minister's power. The evidence, however, is inconclusive.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gajah Mada's role in unifying the Indonesian archipelago caused early Indonesian nationalists to consider him a great national hero, and the first Indonesian university in Jogjakarta, established in 1946, was named after him.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>

An unflagging foe of all tyranny, he devoted his life to fighting oppression.[PARAGRAPH:1]For the greater part of his life most of the native land of Giuseppe Garibaldi was under the control of foreigners. In the north Lombardy was held by Austria, and to the south of the States of the Church the kingdom of Naples was in the hands of the stagnant feudal regime of the Bourbons. Garibaldi was the embodiment of the Italian brand of 19th-century nationalism, which was impelled by the twin desires for unity and freedom.[PARAGRAPH:1]An Italian patriot, Garibaldi began life as a sailor. He associated himself enthusiastically with Mazzini for the liberation of his country, but being convicted of conspiracy, fled to South America where, as both a privateer and a soldier, he gave his services to the young republics struggling there for life. Returning to Europe, Garibaldi took part in the defense of Rome against France. Being defeated, he fled to New York to return to the Isle of Caprera, biding his time. He joined the Piedmontese against Austria and, in 1860, set himself to assist in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Naples and the union of Italy under Victor Emmanuel. Landing in Calabria, Garibaldi entered Naples and drove the royal forces before him without striking a blow, after which he returned to his retreat at Caprera, ready still to draw sword, and occasionally offering it again in the cause of republicanism. Garibaldi died in 1882.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_GERONIMO_PEDIA">[H1]Geronimo [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Apache Warrior and Medicine Man [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1829 - 1909[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB] Goyathlay (Geronimo) was born to the Bedonkohe band of the Apache, near Turkey Creek,[2] a tributary of the Gila River in the modern-day state of New Mexico,[3] then part of Mexico, but which his family considered Bedonkohe land. He had three brothers and four sisters.Geronimo's parents raised him according to Apache traditions. He married a woman from the Chiricahua band of Apache when he was 17; they had three children. On March 6, 1858, a company of 400 Mexican soldiers from Sonora led by Colonel José María Carrasco attacked Geronimo's camp outside Janos while the men were in town trading. Among those killed were Geronimo's wife, Alope, his children, and his mother. His chief, Mangas Coloradas, sent him to Cochise's band for help in revenge against the Mexicans. It was the Mexicans who named him Geronimo. This appellation stemmed from a battle in which he repeatedly attacked Mexican soldiers with a knife, ignoring a deadly hail of bullets, in reference to the Mexicans' plea to Saint Jerome (\"Jeronimo!\"). The name stuck.The first Apache raids on Sonora appear to have taken place during the late 17th century. To counter the early Apache raids on Spanish settlements, presidios were established at Janos (1685) in Chihuahua and at Fronteras (1690) in northern Opata country. In 1835, Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps. Two years later Mangas Coloradas or Dasoda-hae (Red Sleeves) became principal chief and war leader and began a series of retaliatory raids against the Mexicans. Apache raids on Mexican villages were so numerous and brutal that no area was safe.  While Geronimo said he was never a chief, he was a military leader. As a Chiricahua Apache, this meant he was one of many people with special spiritual insights and abilities known to Apache people as \"Power\". Among these were the ability to walk without leaving tracks; the abilities now known as telekinesis and telepathy; and the ability to survive gunshot (rifle/musket, pistol, and shotgun). Geronimo was wounded numerous times by both bullets and buckshot, but survived. Apache men chose to follow him of their own free will, and offered first-hand eye-witness testimony regarding his many \"powers\". They declared that this was the main reason why so many chose to follow him (he was favored by/protected by \"Usen\", the Apache high-god). Geronimo's \"powers\" were considered to be so great that he personally painted the faces of the warriors who followed him to reflect their protective effect. During his career as a war chief, Geronimo was notorious for consistently urging raids and war upon Mexican Provinces and their various towns, and later against American locations across Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas.He married Chee-hash-kish and had two children, Chappo and Dohn-say. Then he took another wife, Nana-tha-thtith, with whom he had one child. He later had a wife named Zi-yeh at the same time as another wife, She-gha, one named Shtsha-she and later a wife named Ih-tedda. Some of his wives were captured, such as the young Ih-tedda. Wives came and went, overlapping each other, being captured and added to the family, lost, or even given up, as Geronimo did with Ih-tedda when he and his band surrendered. At that time he kept his wife She-gha but abandoned the younger wife, Ih-tedda. Geronimo's last wife was Azul.Though outnumbered, Geronimo fought against both Mexican and United States troops and became famous for his daring exploits and numerous escapes from capture from 1858 to 1886. One such escape, as legend has it, took place in the Robledo Mountains of southwest New Mexico. The legend states Geronimo and his followers entered a cave, and the U.S. Soldiers waited outside the cave entrance for him, but he never came out. Later it was heard that Geronimo was spotted in a nearby area. The second entrance to the cave has yet to be found and the cave is still called Geronimo's Cave. At the end of his military career, he led a small band of 36 men, women, and children. They evaded thousands of Mexican and American troops for over a year. His band was one of the last major forces of independent Indian warriors who refused to acknowledge the United States occupation of the American West.n 1886, General Nelson A. Miles selected Captain Henry Lawton, in command of B Troop, 4th Cavalry, at Ft. Huachuca to lead the expedition that captured Geronimo. Numerous stories abound as to who actually captured Geronimo, or to whom he surrendered. For Lawton's part, he was given orders to head up actions south of the U.S.Mexico boundary where it was thought Geronimo and a small band of his followers would take refuge from U.S. authorities. Lawton was to pursue, subdue, and return Geronimo to the U.S., dead or alive.Lawton's official report dated September 9, 1886 sums up the actions of his unit and gives credit to a number of his troopers for their efforts. Geronimo gave credit to Lawton's tenacity for wearing the Apaches down with constant pursuit. Geronimo and his followers had little or no time to rest or stay in one place. Completely worn out, the little band of Apaches returned to the U.S. with Lawton and officially surrendered to General Miles on September 4, 1886 at Skeleton Canyon, Arizona.The debate still remains whether Geronimo surrendered with or without conditions. Geronimo pleaded in his memoirs that his people who surrendered had been misled: his surrender as a war prisoner was conditioned in front of uncontested witnesses (especially General Stanley.) General Howard, chief of Pacific US army division, said on his part that his surrender was accepted as a dangerous outlaw without condition, which has been contested in front of the Senate.  Geronimo and other Apaches were sent as prisoners to Fort Pickens, in Pensacola Florida, and his family was sent to Fort Marion.  They were reunited in May 1887, when they were transferred to Mount Vernon Barracks in Alabama for seven years. In 1894, they were moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. In his old age, Geronimo became a celebrity. He appeared at fairs, including the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, and sold souvenirs and photographs of himself. However, he was not allowed to return to the land of his birth. He also rode in President Theodore Roosevelt's 1905 inaugural parade.  In 1905, Geronimo agreed to tell his story to S. M. Barrett, Superintendent of Education in Lawton, Oklahoma. Barrett had to appeal to President Roosevelt to gain permission to publish the book. Geronimo came to each interview knowing exactly what he wanted to say. He refused to answer questions or alter his narrative. Barrett did not seem to take many liberties with Geronimo's story as translated by Asa Daklugie. Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett's footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.  Geronimo died of pneumonia on February 17, 1909 as a prisoner of the United States at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He was buried there at the Apache Indian Prisoner of War Cemetery.</string>

During this time the feudal lords were all vying for the most power in Albania, while paying tribute to the Ottoman Sultan, which established himself as overlord of the Balkans.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gjergj became involved in politics at an early age, taking trips for his father to the Republic of Venice as a teenager, meeting with cardinals and politicians to discuss the problematic presence of the Ottoman Turks.  This earned him much respect throughout the diplomatic world, along with contacts that he would keep until his death.[PARAGRAPH:1]In order to ensure fidelity to the Sultan, Gjon Kastrioti was required to give up his son to the Empire for service.  Determined to keep his father's possession of Kruja Gjergj joined the Ottoman Empire as a soldier, but never forgot his country, vowing to one day return.  Excelling at warfare, Gjergj quickly rose through the ranks of the Ottoman Army, establishing his natural talent for battle, and gaining an intimate knowledge of Ottoman warfare tactics.[PARAGRAPH:1]Upon Gjon's death in 1443, Sultan Murad claimed for himself the Kastrioti's castle at Kruja.  This, along with his people's lamentations, indicated the need for Kastrioti to take action against the Empire, and rekindled his sense of Albanian pride.  He waited patiently for the most opportune moment to make his move.[PARAGRAPH:1] It came in November of 1443 when Kastrioti, in agreement with Janosh Hunyadi of the Hungarians (at that time the main force opposing Ottoman rule in the Balkans), left the Ottoman ranks with a contingent of Albanian horsemen to reclaim his castle at Kruja.  On March 2, 1444 he united all Albanian princes, land barons, and tribal chieftains at the principality of Lezha in open rebellion against the occupation of the Ottoman armies. He managed to secure nominal support from the Venetian Republic, the Arogonese King of Naples, the kingdom of Spain, the Hungarians, and the Popes of the Holy Catholic Church, which gave him the title \"Athleta Christi\" (Athlete of Christendom).[PARAGRAPH:1] The Albanians under Kastrioti's leadership were able to defeat the most powerful army in the world for 25 years, and kept them from setting foot inside Catholic Western Europe.  By using his knowledge of Ottoman battle tactics, and employing the Kalorse, a fast, Light Guerilla Cavalry, (which could outrun Ottoman forces and cause chaos within enemy ranks), Kastrioti ensured easy victory for the Albanians.[PARAGRAPH:1] About 10 years after Kastrioti's death in 1468, the Turks tore open his grave in search of his bones which they used as talismans, believing that they held mythical power.  The Albanians held out for 12 more years, but could not withstand the might of Mehmet the Conqueror without the genius leadership of their hero.  By 1480, all of Albania was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gjergj Kastrioti's efforts were not in vain, however.  As the father of the Albanian rebellion, Kastrioti was the only man in history ever to completely unite the Albanians.  He was the author of the Albanian national existance, and his people even to this day say his name proudly as they raise the Albanian flag that he once raised to show the world that the Albanians desired freedom, and they would fight to get it.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_GODWINSON_PEDIA">[H1]Harold Godwinson[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Anglo-Saxon King[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c. 1022 - 1066[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]At the end of 1065, King Edward the Confessor ailed and fell into a coma without clarifying his preference for the succession. On 5 January 1066, according to the Vita Ædwardi Regis, he died, but not before briefly regaining consciousness and commending his widow and the kingdom to Harold's \"protection\". The intent of this charge is ambiguous, as is the Bayeux Tapestry, which simply depicts Edward pointing at a man thought to represent Harold.  When the Witenagemot convened the next day, they selected Harold to succeed, and his coronation followed on 6 January, most likely held in Westminster Abbey, however there is no surviving evidence from the time to confirm this.  Although later Norman sources point to the suddenness of this coronation, it is possible that it took place because all the nobles of the land were present at Westminster for the feast of Epiphany, and not because of any usurpation of the throne on Harold's part.  In early January of 1066, hearing that Harold had been crowned King, William Duke of Normandy began plans to invade by building 700 warships and transports at Dives-sur-Mer  on the Normandy coast. Initially William could not get support for the invasion but, claiming that Harold had sworn on sacred relics to support his claim to the throne after having been shipwrecked in Ponthieu, William was given the Church's blessing and nobles flocked to his cause. In anticipation of the invasion, Harold assembled his troops on the Isle of Wight  but, claiming unfavorable winds, the invasion fleet remained in port. On 8 September with provisions running out Harold disbanded the army and he returned to London. On the same day Harald Hardrada of Norway, who also claimed the English crown joined Tostig and invaded, landing his fleet at the mouth of the Tyne.  Invading what is now Yorkshire, Harald Hardrada and Tostig defeated the English earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria at the Battle of Fulford near York on 20 September. They were in turn defeated and slain by Harold's army five days later at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, Harold having led his army north on a forced march from London in four days and caught them by surprise. According to Snorri Sturluson, before the battle a man bravely rode up to Harald Hardrada and Tostig and offered Tostig his earldom if he would but turn on Harald Hardrada. When Tostig asked what his brother Harold would be willing to give Harald Hardrada for his trouble, the rider replied that he would be given seven feet of ground as he was taller than other men. Harald Hardrada was impressed with the rider and asked Tostig his name, Tostig replied that the rider was none other than Harold Godwinson.  According to Henry of Huntingdon, \"Six feet of ground or as much more as he needs, as he is taller than most men,\" was Harold's response. It is, however, unknown whether this conversation ever took place.  On 12 September William's fleet sailed.  Several ships sank in storms and the fleet was forced to take shelter at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme and wait for the wind to change. On 27 September the Norman fleet finally set sail for England arriving it is believed the following day at Pevensey on the coast of East Sussex. Harold now again forced his army to march 241 miles (386 kilometres) to intercept William, who had landed perhaps 7000 men in Sussex, southern England. Harold established his army in hastily built earthworks near Hastings. The two armies clashed at the Battle of Hastings, at Senlac Hill (near the present town of Battle) close by Hastings on 14 October, where after nine hours of hard fighting and less than 30 minutes from victory Harold was killed and his forces routed.  His brothers Gyrth and Leofwine were also killed in the battle.According to tradition, Harold was killed by an arrow in the eye. A figure in the Bayeux Tapestry  appears consistent with this tradition, if that is indeed the type of wound originally depicted in the now-altered artwork. Older etchings made of the tapestry made c. 1730 show the standing figure holding what appears to be part of a spear shaft, rather than clutching an arrow.  Likewise, historians are divided over whether the man so wounded is intended to be Harold (the figure has Harold's name above) or if Harold is the next figure, being mutilated beneath a horse's hooves. The contemporary account of the battle \"Carmen de Hastingae Proelio\" (the Song of the Battle of Hastings), written shortly after the battle by Guy, Bishop of Amiens, says that Harold was killed by four knights, probably including Duke William, and his body brutally dismembered. Examination has shown that the second figure once had an arrow in its eye that had later been unstitched, but this may have been the work of overenthusiastic nineteenth century restorers which was soon removed. A further suggestion is that both accounts are accurate, and that Harold suffered first the eye wound, then the mutilation, and both are being depicted in sequence. Harold's wife, Edith Swannesha, was called to identify the body, which she did by some private mark known only to herself.  Harold's strong association with Bosham, his birthplace, and the discovery of an Anglo-Saxon coffin in the church in 1954 has led some to speculate that King Harold was buried there. A request to exhume a grave in Bosham church was refused by the Diocese of Chichester  in December 2003, the Chancellor ruling that the chances of establishing the identity of the body as Harold's were too slim to justify disturbing a burial place.  A prior exhumation had revealed the remains of a man, estimated at up to 60 years of age from photographs of the remains, lacking a head, one leg and the lower part of his other leg, a description consistent with the fate of the king as depicted in the Carmen. The poem also claims Harold was buried by the sea which is consistent with it being at Bosham Church which is only yards from Chichester Harbour and in sight of the English Channel.  There were legends of Harold's body being given a proper funeral years later in his church of Waltham Holy Cross in Essex, which he had refounded in 1060. There is a legend that Henry I of England met an elderly monk at Waltham Abbey, who was in fact a very old Harold. King Harold had a son posthumously, called Harold Haroldsson, who may have been this man, and may also be the occupant of the grave.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_GUSTAV_PEDIA">[H1]Gustavus Adolphus[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Sweden[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1594 - 1632[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Gustavus Adolphus's death at the battle of Lützen at the moment of victory was a fitting end for a man who devoted himself to war. As the ruler of a Protestant country he became involved in the Thirty Years War in Germany, but he also fought against Denmark and Russia for control of the Baltic. He served his military apprenticeship in Poland, where he learnt valuable lessons about strategy and tactics, which he was later to employ in his German campaigns. Also, although not so often highlighted, as the ruler of a country with a seaborne tradition, Gustavus took a great interest in developing Sweden's navy to defend her shores and extend his authority over the Baltic Sea and its littoral.[PARAGRAPH:1]Only 16 when he assumed the throne in 1611, Gustavus first had to defend his country against Danish invasion. He also became engaged in a war with Russia which lasted until 1617. In the 1620s he began a series of successful campaigns to win control of the southern Baltic shore. He captured Riga in 1621, after a siege of only eleven weeks. From 1626-9 he launched annual attacks upon Polish Prussia, winning his first victory in open field at Wallhof. Despite a setback at Hammerstein the following year, when his German mercenaries surrendered, Gustavus again defeated the Poles at Dirschau (8 August) although he was severely wounded in the neck. Helped by imperial Habsburg forces, the Poles were able to achieve a six-year truce in 1629.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gustavus learnt valuable lessons in his earlier wars which were to stand him in good stead for his invasion of Germany in 1630-2. First, he learnt not to rely entirely on mercenaries. Although the Swedish population was small, a system of conscription, a tithe of the male population over 15 years old, organized by his chancellor, Oxenstierna, yielded a field army theoretically up to 30,000 strong. In addition, mercenary troops largely recruited from Protestant Germans still played an important role, especially the 'Coloured Regiments'. The infantry were also reorganized tactically upon the model of Maurice of Nassau. Company sizes were halved from 250 to about 140, with a 2 : 1 proportion of muskets to pikes (administratively eight companies to a regiment). In the field, they were deployed as small brigades of three or four squadrons (400-600 men) which anticipated later battalions. They were formed-up with one squadron thrown forward in a T-shape, which made the best use of their firepower, and allowed them to outmanoeuvre the larger tercios of the Spanish manner still used by the Imperialists. Gustavus's experience against the Poles had taught him the value of a mobile cavalry at a time when caracole tactics had reduced most western European horse to the role of mounted pistoleers. He taught them to charge with the sword, restoring their battlefield shock function. Finally, through the inspired developments of his master gunner Tortensson, the artillery became lighter and more numerous. In addition, each regiment was given a pair of rapid-firing and mobile 4-pounders to boost its firepower.[PARAGRAPH:1]In July 1630, Gustavus led only 13,000 men into Germany to rescue the Protestant cause, captured Stettin, and spent the rest of the year consolidating his position in Pomerania. The following spring, reinforced to 30,000 men, he swept south in a devastating campaign which included the destruction of enemy cavalry forces by night attack at Burgstall. In September he outmanoeuvred the imperial general Tilly and forced a battle at Breitenfeld. By now commanding over 40, 000 men, including 10, 000 Saxon allies, he matched Tilly's forces and outnumbered the enemy artillery by two to one. Although the Saxons on the left wing were scattered by the charge of the imperial cavalry, the flexibility of the Swedish formations and their determination won the day. Galled by artillery fire, the imperial cavalry under Pappenheim charged and was taken in the flank by Baner's quickly manoeuvred mixed squadrons of horse and musketeers. Responding rapidly to the situation Gustavus advanced his foot and seized the enemy guns. When these were turned on the close-packed imperial foot, a massacre ensued. Tilly lost a third of his army. The following spring, after a brilliant and unexpected crossing of the river Lech, Gustavus defeated him again and Tilly was killed.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Gustavus attempted to drive the imperial army, now commanded by the able Wallenstein, from a fortified camp at Nuremberg, he suffered a bloody repulse. Wallenstein then outmanoeuvred the Swedes and forced Gustavus into a desperate encounter at Lützen, in which the Swedish king was killed leading a cavalry charge. Even without his leadership his army won another victory in 1633, but was defeated at Nordlingen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gustavus's ambition and will to war had made Sweden, briefly, a major player on the European stage both on land and at sea, but at an unsustainable cost. The system of conscription, bringing over 10, 000 men to the colours every year, saw numbers of men aged 15-60 fall by almost half in an already underpopulated nation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gustavus Adolphus was killed at the Battle of Lützen, when, at a crucial point in the battle, he became separated from his troops while leading a cavalry charge into a dense smog of mist and gunpowder smoke. After his death, his wife initially kept his body, and later his heart, in her castle for over a year. His remains (including his heart) now rest in Riddarholmskyrkan in Stockholm.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_HAAKON_PEDIA">[H1]Haakon VII[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Norway[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1872 - 1957[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]After the Union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved  in 1905, a committee of the Norwegian government identified several members of European royalty as candidates for Norway's first King of its own in several centuries. Gradually, Prince Carl became the leading candidate, largely because of the fact that he was descended from independent Norwegian kings. He also had a son (and hence an heir to the throne), and Princess Maud's ties to the British Royal Family were viewed as advantageous to the newly independent Norwegian nation.  The democratically minded Carl, aware that Norway was still debating whether to retain its monarchy or to switch to a republican  system of government, was flattered by the Norwegian government's overtures, but declined to accept the offer without a referendum to show whether monarchy was truly the choice of the Norwegian people.  After the referendum overwhelmingly confirmed by 79 percent majority that Norwegians desired to retain a monarchy, Prince Carl was formally offered the throne of Norway by the Storting  (parliament) and elected on 18 November 1905. When Carl accepted the offer that same evening (after the approval of his grandfather Christian IX of Denmark), he immediately endeared himself to his adopted country by taking the Old Norse name of Haakon, a name used by previous Kings of Norway.  In so doing, he succeeded his grand-uncle, Oscar II of Sweden, who had abdicated the Norwegian throne in October following the agreement between Sweden and Norway on the terms of the separation of the union.  King Haakon gained much sympathy from the Norwegian people. He traveled around and visited many places. He participated in the political process after the first prime minister from the labor party was chosen in 1928, a process that caused a special parliamentary situation.Norway was invaded by the naval and air forces of Nazi Germany during the early hours of 9 April 1940. The German naval detachment sent to capture Oslo was challenged at Oscarsborg Fortress. The fortress fired at the invaders, causing damage to the pocket battleship Lützow and sinking the heavy cruiser Blücher, with heavy German losses that included many of the armed forces, Gestapo agents, and administrative personnel who were to have occupied the Norwegian capital. These events led to the withdrawal of the rest of the German flotilla, preventing the invaders from occupying Oslo at dawn as had been intended in the order of battle. The German occupation forces' delay in occupying Oslo, along with swift action from the President of the Storting, C. J Hambro, created the opportunity for the Norwegian Royal Family, the Cabinet, and most of the 150 members of the Storting (parliament) to make a hasty departure from the capital by special train.  The Storting first convened at Hamar the same afternoon, but with the rapid advance of German troops, the group moved on to Elverum. The assembled Parliament unanimously enacted a resolution, the so-called Elverumsfullmakten (Elverum Authorization), granting the Cabinet full powers to protect the country until such time as the Storting could meet again.  The next day, German Minister Curt Bräuer demanded a meeting with Haakon. The German diplomat called on the Norwegians to cease their resistance and stated Hitler's demand that the King appoint Nazi sympathizer Vidkun Quisling, who had declared himself prime minister hours earlier in Oslo, as head of what would be a German puppet government. Bräuer suggested that Haakon follow the example of the Danish government and his brother, Christian X, which had surrendered almost immediately after the previous day's invasion, and threatened Norway with harsh conditions if it did not surrender. Haakon told Bräuer that he could not make such a decision himself, but only on the advice of the Government. Although the Constitution of Norway nominally gives the King the final responsibility for making such a decision, in practice nearly all major governmental decisions are made by the Government (the Council of State) in his name.  Haakon went on to say that he could not appoint any government headed by Quisling because he knew neither the people nor the Storting had confidence in him. However, if the Cabinet felt otherwise, the King said he would abdicate so as not to stand in the way of the Government's decision.  Nils Hjelmtveit, Minister of Church and Education, later wrote: \"This made a great impression on us all. More clearly than ever before we could see the man behind the words; the king who had drawn a line for himself and his task, a line from which he could not deviate. We had through the five years [in government] learned to respect and appreciate our king and now, through his words, he came to us as a great man, just and forceful; a leader in these fatal times to our country.\"  Inspired by Haakon's stand, the Government unanimously advised Haakon not to appoint any government headed by Quisling. Within hours, it telephoned its refusal to Bräuer. That night, NRK broadcast the government's refusal to the Norwegian people. In that same broadcast, the government announced that they would resist the German attack as long as possible, and expressed their confidence that Norwegians would lend their support to the cause.  The following morning, 11 April 1940, bomber aircraft of the Luftwaffe  attacked Nybergsund, destroying the small town where the Norwegian government was staying in an attempt to wipe out Norway's unyielding King and Government. The King and his ministers took refuge in the snow-covered woods and escaped harm, continuing farther north through the rugged Norwegian mountains toward Molde  on Norway's northwestern coast. As the British forces in the area lost ground under Luftwaffe bombardment, the King and his party were taken aboard the British cruiser HMS Glasgow at Molde and conveyed by sea another 1000 km north to Tromsø where a provisional capital was established on 1 May. Haakon and Crown Prince Olav took up residence in a forest cabin in Maalselvdalen valley in inner Troms county where they would stay until the evacuation to the United Kingdom. While residing in Troms the two were protected by local rifle association members armed with the ubiquitous Krag-Jørgensen rifle.  During Norway's five years under German control, many Norwegians surreptitiously wore clothing or jewelry made from coins bearing Haakon's \"H7\" monogram as symbols of resistance to the German occupation and of solidarity with their exiled king and government, just as many people in Denmark wore his brother's monogram on a pin. The King's monogram was also painted and otherwise reproduced on various surfaces as a show of resistance to the occupation.  After the end of the war, Haakon and the Norwegian Royal Family returned to Norway aboard the cruiser HMS Norfolk, arriving with the First Cruiser Squadron to cheering crowds in Oslo on 7 June 1945 exactly five years after they had been evacuated from Tromsø.In 1947 the Norwegian people, by public subscription, purchased the Royal Yacht, Norge, for the King. In 2009 it remains as one of only two such vessels belonging to a European monarch. The other yacht belonging to the Queen of Denmark.  King Haakon VII fell in his bathroom at the estate at Bygdøy in July 1955. This fall, which occurred just a month before his eighty-third birthday, broke the King's thighbone and, although there were few other complications resulting from the fall, the King was left confined to a wheelchair. The once-active king was said to have been depressed by his resulting helplessness and began to lose his customary involvement and interest in current events. With Haakon's loss of mobility, and as the King's health deteriorated further in the summer of 1957, Crown Prince Olav appeared on behalf of his father on ceremonial occasions and took a more active role in state affairs. At Haakon's death in 1957, the Crown Prince succeeded as Olav V.  Today, King Haakon is regarded by many as one of the greatest Norwegian leaders of the pre-war period, managing to hold his young and fragile country together in unstable political conditions. In 1927 he said, \"I am also the King of the Communists\" (Norwegian: \"Jeg er ogsaa kommunistenes konge\").  His loyalty to democracy proved to be crucial for the political situation of Norway during and after World War II.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_HAAKONSON_PEDIA">[H1]Haakon Haakonsson[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Norway[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1204 - 1263[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Haakon's mother was Inga of Varteig. She claimed he was the illegitimate son of Haakon III of Norway, the leader of the birkebeiner faction in the ongoing civil war against the bagler. Haakon III had visited Varteig, in what is now Østfold  county, the previous year. He was dead by the time Haakon was born, but Inga's claim was supported by several of Haakon III's followers, and the birkebeiner recognized Haakon as a king's son.  The civil war era in Norwegian history lasted from 1130 to 1240. During this period there were several interlocked conflicts of varying scale and intensity. The background for these conflicts were the unclear Norwegian succession laws, social conditions and the struggle between different aristocratic parties and between Church and King. There were opposing factions, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensed into the two parties birkebeiner and bagler. The rallying point regularly was a royal son, who was set up as the figurehead of the party in question, to oppose the rule of king from the contesting party. Haakon's putative father Haakon III had already sought some reconciliation with the Bagler party and with exiled bishops. His death was early and poisoning was suspected. He was not married. After his death, the bagler started another rising leading to the de facto division of the country into a bagler kingdom in the south-east, and a birkebeiner kingdom in the west and north.  Haakon was born in territory which was controlled by the Bagler faction, and his mother's claim that he was a birkebeiner royal son placed them both in a very dangerous position. When in 1206 the Bagler tried to take advantage of the situation and started hunting Haakon, a group of Birkebeiner warriors fled with the child, heading for King Inge II of Norway, the birkebeiner king in Nidaros (now Trondheim). On their way they came into a blizzard, and only the two mightiest warriors, Torstein Skevla and Skjervald Skrukka, continued on skis, carrying the child in their arms. They managed to bring the heir to safety. This event still is commemorated in one of Norway's most important annual skiing event, the Birkebeiner ski race.The rescued child was placed under the protection of King Inge Baardsson. After King Inge's death in 1217 he, at the age of 13, was chosen king. Haakon was chosen against the candidacy of Inge's half-brother, earl Skule Baardsson. Skule, however, as earl, retained the real royal power. In connection with the dispute over the royal election, Haakon's mother Inga had to prove his parentage through a trial by ordeal in Bergen in 1218. The church at first refused to recognize him, partly on the ground of illegitimacy.In 1223 a great meeting of all the bishops, earls, lendmenn and other prominent men was held in Bergen to finally decide on Haakon's right to the throne. The other candidates to the throne were Guttorm Ingesson, the 11-year-old illegitimate son of King Inge Baardsson; Knut Haakonson, legitimate son of earl Haakon the Crazy, who resided in Västergötland, Sweden, with his mother Kristin; earl Skule, who based his claim on being the closest living relative - a legitimate brother - of king Inge; and Sigurd Ribbung, who was at the time a captive of earl Skule. Haakon was confirmed as king of Norway, as a direct heir of King Haakon Sverresson, king Inge's predecessor. A most important factor in his victory was the fact that the church now took Haakon's side, despite his illegitimate birth. However, the Pope's dispensation for his coronation was not gained until 1247.  In 1217, Philip Simonsson, the last Bagler king, died. Speedy political and military manoeuvering by Skule Baardsson led to reconciliation between the birkebeiner and bagler, and the reunification of the kingdom. However, some discontented elements among the bagler found a new royal pretender, Sigurd Ribbung and launched a new rising in the eastern parts of the country. This was finally quashed in 1227, leaving Haakon more or less uncontested monarch.  In the earlier part of Haakon's reign much of the royal power was in the hands of Skule Baardsson. From the start of his reign, it was decided that Skule should rule one third of the kingdom, as earl, and Skule helped put down the rising of Sigurd Ribbung. But the relationship between Skule and Haakon became more and more strained as Haakon came of age, and asserted his power. As an attempt to reconcile the two, in 1225 Haakon married Skule's daughter Margrét Skúladóttir. In 1239 the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare, when Skule had himself proclaimed king in Nidaros. The rebellion ended in 1240 when Skule was put to death. The rebellion also led to the death of Snorri Sturluson. Skule's other son-in-law, the one-time claimant Knut Haakonsson, did not join the revolt, but remained loyal to king Haakon. This rebellion is generally taken to mark the end of Norway's age of civil wars.From this time onward Haakons reign was marked by internal peace and more prosperity than Norway had known for many years. This was the start of what has traditionally been known as the golden age of the Norwegian medieval kingdom. In 1240, a group of Bjarmians told Haakon that they were refugees from the Mongols. He gave them land in Malangen. In 1247 Haakon finally achieved recognition by the pope, who sent Cardinal William of Sabina to Bergen to crown him. Abroad, Haakon mounted a campaign against the Danish province of Halland in 1256. In 1261 the Norse community in Greenland agreed to submit to the Norwegian king, and in 1262, Haakon achieved one of his long-standing ambitions when Iceland, racked by internal conflict and prompted by Haakon's Icelandic clients, did the same. The kingdom of Norway was now the largest it has ever been. In 1263 a dispute with the Scottish king concerning the Hebrides, a Norwegian possession, induced Haakon to undertake an expedition to the west of Scotland. Alexander III of Scotland had conquered the Hebrides the previous year. Haakon retook the islands with his formidable leidang  fleet, and launched some forays onto the Scottish mainland as well. A division of his army seems to have repulsed a large Scottish force at Largs  (though the later Scottish accounts claim this battle as a victory). Negotiations between the Scots and the Norwegians took place, which were purposely prolonged by the Scots, as Haakon's position would grow more difficult the longer he had to keep his fleet together so far away from home. An Irish delegation approached Haakon with an offer to provide for his fleet through the winter, if Haakon would help them against the English. Haakon seems to have been favorable to this proposition, but his men refused. Eventually the fleet retreated to the Orkney Islands for the winter.  While Haakon was wintering in the Orkney Islands and staying in the Bishop's Palace, Kirkwall, he fell ill, and died on December 16, 1263. A great part of his fleet had been scattered and destroyed by storms. Haakon was buried for the winter in St. Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. When spring came he was exhumed and his body taken back to Norway, where he was buried in the old cathedral in his capital, Bergen. This cathedral was demolished in 1531, the site is today marked by a memorial.  On his deathbed Haakon declared that he only knew of one son who was still alive, Magnus, who subsequently succeeded him as king.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_HASINA_PEDIA">[H1]Sheikh Hasina Wazed[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Bangladesh[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1947 - [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Sheikh Hasina Wazed is a Bangladeshi politician and current Prime Minister of Bangladesh. She has been the President of the Awami League, a major political party, since 1981. She is the eldest of five children of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father (and first president) of Bangladesh and wife of an internationally reputed nuclear scientist, M. A. Wazed Miah. Sheikh Hasina's party defeated the BNP-led Four-Party Alliance in the 2008 parliamentary elections, thus assuring her of the post of prime minister. Sheikh Hasina has once before held the office, from 1996 to 2001.[PARAGRAPH:1]While living in self-exile in India, Sheikh Hasina was elected the president of Bangladesh Awami League in 1981. After she returned to the country, the president Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in yet another coup in May, 1981. The following year, General Hossain Mohammad Ershad captured power through a bloodless coup and declared martial law. In 1983, Hasina formed the 15-party alliance to launch a movement to oust him from power. She was in and out of prison throughout the 1980s. Her party, along with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by Rahman's widow Khaleda Zia, was instrumental in the movement against the military rule. In 1984, Hasina was put under house arrest in February and then again in November. In March 1985, she was put under house arrest for three months.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1990, Hasina's 8 party alliance was instrumental along with another BNP-led alliance in finally removing the Ershad regime. Under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina, Awami League formed an alliance with Ershad's Jayiya Party in 2006[PARAGRAPH:1]On July 16, 2007 Hasina was arrested by state police at her home and taken before a local court in Dhaka. She was accused of extortion and denied bail on the same day, and was held in a building converted into a jail on the premises of the National Parliament. According to the Awami League, the arrest was politically motivated. On June 11, 2008 Hasina was released on parole for medical reasons and the next day she flew to the United States to be treated for hearing impairment, eye problems and high blood pressure. Prof. Syed Modasser Ali, her personal physician, threatened to sue the caretaker government over negligence regarding Hasina's treatment during her detention.[PARAGRAPH:1]In November 6, 2008 Hasina returned to Bangladesh to lead her party in general elections scheduled for December 29, 2008. On December 11, 2008 Sheikh Hasina announced her party's election manifesto during a news conference.In her election manifesto she vowed to build a \"Digital Bangladesh\" by 2021. Sheikh Hasina's Awami league won the elections on 29 December 2008 with an overwhelming majority.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sheikh Hasina's party defeated Begum Khaleda Zia's BNP in the 2008 Parliamentary Elections. Her party achieved a landslide victory reminiscent to the 1971 elections of Pakistan. Under her leadership, the party has achieved a supermajority in parliament, controlling 230 seats out of 299. She was sworn into office as the Prime Minister for the second time on 6 January, 2009. The Prime Minister is the most powerful executive position in Bangladesh, although technically of lower seniority when compared to the office of President. Begum Zia, however, rejected the results of the election, sarcastically thanking the Chief Election Commissioner \"for stage-managing the parliamentary election\" in a statement. But, according to the views expressed by foreign and local election observers, the general election was free, fair and credible. </string>

He was the eldest son of Mohammed V, Sultan, then King of Morocco and his wife Lalla Abla bint Tahar, whom he married in 1926. King Hassan was educated at the Imperial College at Rabat and earned a law degree from the University of Bordeaux. He was exiled to Corsica by French authorities on 20 August 1953, along with his father Sultan Mohammed V. They were transferred to Madagascar in January 1954. Prince Hassan acted as his father's political advisor during the exile. Mohammed V and his family returned from exile on 16 November 1955.[PARAGRAPH:1]Prince Hassan participated in the February 1956 negotiations for Morocco's independence with his father, who later appointed him Chief of Staff of the Royal Armed Forces in April 1956. In the unrest of the same year, he led army contingents battling Berbers in the mountains of the Rif. Mohammed V changed the title of the Moroccan sovereign from Sultan to King in 1957. Hassan was proclaimed Crown Prince on 19 July 1957, and became King on 3 March 1961, after his father's death.[PARAGRAPH:1]His conservative rule strengthened the Alaouite Dynasty, but his refusal to share power with the political parties, instead relying on the makhzen elite, provoked political protest. While king Hassan did not abolish the mechanisms of parliamentary democracy, he dissolved parliament and ruled directly. When elections were eventually held, they were blatantly rigged in favor of loyal parties. This caused severe discontent among the opposition, and protest demonstrations and riots challenged the king's rule. In the early seventies, the mounting discontent spread to the army, and King Hassan survived two assassination attempts. The first, in 1971, was organized by army cadets. In 1972, during a second attempted at a coup d'état, jets from the Royal Moroccan Air Force fired upon the King's Boeing 727 while he was traveling back to Rabat, but did not bring it down. After this, tensions slowly cooled down, aided by the king's newfound nationalist credentials in claiming Western Sahara in 1975.[PARAGRAPH:1]The rigidly dictatorial period from the 60s to the early 90s is known as the \"years of lead\", and saw many thousands of dissidents shot, jailed, exiled or forcibly disappeared. Although king Hassan II had restored many parliamentary functions by the early nineties and released hundreds of political prisoners in 1991 after pressure from the United States, the \"years of lead\" ended definitely only with the taking of the throne by his son Mohammed VI in 1999.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_HECTOR_PEDIA">[H1]Hector[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prince of Troy[\BOLD][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]In Greek mythology, Hector, or Hektor, was a Trojan prince and one of the greatest fighters in the Trojan War, equal to Ajax and surpassed only by Achilles.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was the son of Priam and Hecuba, his younger brother being the less brave Paris (Paris is commonly looked upon as a cowardly lover, who brought on the downfall of the kingdom of Troy over an affair with Helen). With his wife, Andromache, he fathered Astyanax. He had a horse named Lampos and friends named Misenus and Poludamas. His charioteer was Cebriones, his half-brother.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the Iliad, Homer calls him \"breaker of horses,\" largely to maintain the meter of his lines and because Troy in general was known for horse raising. Another epithet applied to him is \"of the flashing helmet\".[PARAGRAPH:1]Hector provides a stark contrast for Achilles, who was from first to last a man of war. Hector represents Troy and what it stood for. Some modern scholars have even suggested that he, not Achilles, is the true hero of the Iliad. Hector was fighting not for personal glory, but in defense of his homeland.[PARAGRAPH:1]His rebuke to Poludamas, \"Fight for your country - that is the first and only omen\" became a proverb to patriotic Greeks. Through him we can see glimpses of what life in Troy and elsewhere in the Bronze Age Mediterranean civilization depicted by Homer might have been like in more peaceful times. The scene where he bids farewell to his wife Andromache and his infant son is one of the more moving scenes in the Iliad. In the second battle at Troy Hector told his men, \"I have abided by three laws in my life. Honor the gods, love your woman, and defend your country\".[PARAGRAPH:1]Hector shares some of the same faults as Achilles, and does have a great amount of pride that proves to be disastrous for the Trojans. Both were their armies' greatest champions, and both serve as the driving force of the morale for their armies.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hector was a great warrior. During the Trojan War, Hector killed Protesilaus and was wounded by Ajax during combat. In the portion of the war described in the Iliad, he fights with many of the Greek warriors and usually (but not always) succeeds in killing or wounding his opponent. When, with the assistance of Apollo, he kills Achilles' companion Patroclus and throws the entire Greek force into disarray, it seems that the war has reached a turning point.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hector's personal fate, as decreed by Zeus early on in the story, is never in doubt. Achilles, enraged over the death of Patroclus, ends his refusal to fight and challenges Hector. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena, dressed as a Trojan, persuades Hector to fight face to face. Achilles, aided by the gods, kills Hector with a blow to the neck. Andromache knows of her husband's death instantly from the wailing of the Trojans who witnessed it, and watches from the city walls as Achilles draws a rope through Hector's feet. Hector's body is then dragged behind Achilles' chariot around the battlefield for thirteen days. Priam is initially denied the sacred right of burying his eldest son.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the assistance of the god Hermes, Priam convinces Achilles to permit him to allow Hector his funeral rights. The final passage in the Iliad is his funeral, after which the doom of Troy is just a matter of time. In the final sack of Troy, as described in Book II of the Aeneid, his father and many of his brothers are killed, his son is hurled from the walls in fear that he would avenge Hector, and his wife is carried off by Achilles' son Neoptolemus to live as a slave.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_HIDALGO_PEDIA">[H1]Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Revolutionary, Priest[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] May 8, 1753 - July 30, 1811 AD [NEWLINE] [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD] [PARAGRAPH:1]Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (1753-1811), a Mexican revolutionary priest, is considered the foremost patriot of Mexican independence. He led a revolt against Spanish rule that inaugurated a series of military and political episodes culminating in the achievement of Mexican independence in 1821.[PARAGRAPH:1]Miguel Hidalgo was born a Creole on May 8, 1753. His father was the administrator of a hacienda in the Bajío (in the present state of Guanajuato). Miguel was trained briefly in a Jesuit school before the order was expelled from the empire in 1767. Later that year he matriculated in the diocesan College of San Nicolás in Valladolid (now Morelia). Hidalgo was intellectually oriented and chose to remain part of the academic community long after he had earned degrees in theology and had been ordained. By 1776 he was a member of the San Nicolás faculty and remained in Valladolid until 1792 as an academician, an exponent of the Enlightenment, and a Don Juan. In 1790 he became rector of the college, but his advanced ideas and mismanagement of funds soon led to his ouster.[PARAGRAPH:1]From 1792 until 1810 Hidalgo served as parish priest in a succession of curacies. While in San Felipe (1793-1803), he made his house a salon and promoted French theatrical works (which he translated), orchestral music, dances, and literary discussions. The Inquisition investigated his activities (1800-1801) but did not press charges. On his arrival in Dolores near Guanajuato in 1803, Hidalgo turned to more socioeconomic interests. These he expressed through his development of local craft industries (ceramics, tanning, sericulture) for the benefit of the Indian and caste population.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the Napoleonic invasion of Spain in 1808, Mexico's own crisis began. Hidalgo's search for intellectual companionship had brought him into contact with prominent Creoles throughout the Bajío, Michoacán, and adjacent areas. When the Creoles in Querétaro organized a plot to expel the dominant peninsular Spaniards and to substitute themselves in power, Hidalgo joined. Articulate, well informed, and charismatic, he soon emerged as the uprising's leader, with Ignacio Allende, a militia captain, as second in command.[PARAGRAPH:1]Exposed in early September 1810, the conspirators were forced to revolt prematurely. In a dramatic episode, Hidalgo put the plan into effect on September 16 by delivering an impassioned speech, the Grito de Dolores, to his parishioners. Avoiding abstractions like \"independence,\" which were meaningless to the untutored villagers, he couched his revolutionary appeals in traditional protest language: the Catholic religion and the exiled king, Ferdinand VII, were extolled, and \"death to bad government,\" represented by the peninsular Spaniards, was urged. The native patroness, the Virgin of Guadalupe, was added to the slogans, and her image became the banner of the revolt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hidalgo permitted Indians and castes to join his holy war of redemption in such numbers that the original white Creole motives of the insurrection were obscured. The jacquerie swept through the Bajío, burning and looting, until it engulfed the mining center of Guanajuato on September 28. The massacre of the Spanish defenders of the fortress granary and the subsequent sack of the city set the tone for the Hidalgo revolt. Hidalgo took Valladolid in mid-October and then marched on Mexico City. His horde numbered some 80,000 as it approached the viceregal capital.[PARAGRAPH:1]Meanwhile, the royalist government in Mexico City, under the leadership of Viceroy Francisco Venegas, had prepared defenses as much psychological as military. An intensive propaganda campaign had advertised the destructive horrors of the social revolution and revealed its threat to vested Creole interests. Hidalgo won a Pyrrhic victory on October 30 at Monte de las Cruces on the divide between Toluca and the capital but found the sedentary Indians and castes of the Valley of Mexico as much opposed to the Bajío intruders as were the Creoles and Spaniards. Threatened from the north by an army under the royalist general Félix Calleja, Hidalgo withdrew to Guadalajara to recoup without attacking Mexico City.[PARAGRAPH:1]From his new base, Hidalgo made rudimentary efforts to establish a separatist government and to ameliorate the economic plight of the lower sectors of society (abolition of slavery and tribute were confirmed, and lands were ordered restored to Indian communities). Hidalgo, a strong egoist, however, assumed grandiose airs and exacerbated a growing schism with Allende's Creole faction. In January 1811 Calleja threatened Guadalajara, and Hidalgo advanced east to meet him at the bridge of Calderón with nearly 100,000 men. Calleja's disciplined army of 7,000 men defeated Hidalgo's horde on January 17, and Hidalgo fled north.[PARAGRAPH:1]Suspended from command by the Allende party, Hidalgo was only a figurehead during the retreat. Allende's attempt in March to reach the United States was thwarted at Baján north of Saltillo, and the major leaders of the rebellion were captured. Hidalgo and his companions were removed to Chihuahua for trial and the inevitable executions. Aware that his enterprise had been a catastrophe, Hidalgo repented and apparently signed a public retraction. He was shot on July 30, 1811, and his body decapitated.[PARAGRAPH:1]After Hidalgo's death his cause languished in spite of the efforts of José María Morelos, for the Creole majority remained opposed. In 1821 Agustín de Iturbide engineered a conservative independence and established a short-lived empire. After the republican overthrown of Iturbide, Hidalgo emerged as a patriotic hero. Modern Mexico venerates him as the Padre de la Patria, and the anniversary of his Grito is celebrated on September 16 as Mexico's independence day.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_HIRAM_PEDIA">[H1]Hiram I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Phoenician king of Tyre[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c.990 - 936 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]During Hiram's reign, Tyre grew from a satellite of Sidon into the most important of Phoenician cities, and the holder of a large trading empire. He suppressed the rebellion of the first Tyrean colony at Utica, near the later site of Carthage.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hiram is best known for having allied himself with King Solomon of Israel, the upcoming power of the region; together they would fill the power gap left by the retreat of Egypt when Assyria and Damascus were unable to do so. Through the alliance with Solomon, Hiram ensured himself access to the major trade routes to Egypt, Arabia and Mesopotamia. The two kings also joined forces in starting a trade route over the Red Sea, connecting the Israelite harbour of Ezion-Geber with a land called Ophir.[PARAGRAPH:1]Both kings grew rich through this trade. According to the Bible, Hiram sent Solomon architects, workmen and cedar wood to build the First Temple in Jerusalem. He also extended the Tyrean harbour, enlarged the city by joining the two islands on which it was built, and built a royal palace and a temple for Melqart.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hiram I plays a role in Freemasonic tradition as a provider of materials, money and craftsmen for the construction of Solomon's Temple. This comes from the Biblical account of the alliance between Solomon's Israel and Hiram I's Tyre. Most importantly, he is said to have sent his master craftsmen, Hiram Abiff, to serve as the construction's foreman. Some believe that the two Hirams in the story are the same because they share a name and both are from Tyre. Hiram Abiff should be identified with the \"cunning man\" sent by King Hiram to help erect the temple in 2 Chronicles 2:13-14. It is likely, therefore, that a mis-interpretation of this Bible passage lead to the duplicate name. The Freemasonic tradition expands on the few, short Biblical references and creates an allegory that is not purported to be factual. During the height of Masonic membership in the United States, Hiram became a common name.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_HO_CHI_MINH_PEDIA">[H1]Ho Chi Minh[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Chairman of the Communist Party of Vietnam[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1890 - 1969 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Ho Chi Minh was the leader of the Vietnamese independence struggles against both the French and American Empires. Ho Chi Minh, real name Nguyen Tat Thanh (1890-1969), Vietnamese Communist leader and the principal force behind the Vietnamese struggle against French colonial rule. Ho was born on May 19, 1890, in the village of Kimlien, Annam (central Vietnam), the son of an official who had resigned in protest against French domination of his country. Ho attended school in Hue and then briefly taught at a private school in Phan Thiet. In 1911 he was employed as a cook on a French steamship liner and thereafter worked in London and Paris. After World War I, using the pseudonym Nguyen Ai Quoc (Nguyen the Patriot), Ho engaged in radical activities and was in the founding group of the French Communist party. He was summoned to Moscow for training and, in late 1924, he was sent to Canton, China, where he organized a revolutionary movement among Vietnamese exiles.[PARAGRAPH:1]  He was forced to leave China when local authorities cracked down on Communist activities, but he returned in 1930 to found the Indochinese Communist party (ICP). He stayed in Hong Kong as representative of the Communist International. In June 1931 Ho was arrested there by British police and remained in prison until his release in 1933. He then made his way back to the Soviet Union, where he reportedly spent several years recovering from tuberculosis.[PARAGRAPH:1] In 1938 he returned to China and served as an adviser with Chinese Communist armed forces. When Japan occupied Vietnam in 1941, he resumed contact with ICP leaders and helped to found a new Communist-dominated independence movement, popularly known as the Vietminh, that fought the Japanese.[PARAGRAPH:1] In August 1945, when Japan surrendered, the Vietminh seized power and proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in Hanoi. Ho Chi Minh, now known by his final and best-known pseudonym (which means the Enlightener), became president. The French were unwilling to grant independence to their colonial subjects, and in late 1946 war broke out. For eight years Vietminh guerrillas fought French troops in the mountains and rice paddies of Vietnam, finally defeating them in the decisive Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954. Ho, however, was deprived of his victory.[PARAGRAPH:1] Subsequent negotiations at Geneva divided the country, with only the North assigned to the Vietminh. The DRV, with Ho still president, now devoted its efforts to constructing a Communist society in North Vietnam. In the early 1960s, however, conflict resumed in the South, where Communist-led guerrillas mounted an insurgency against the U.S.-supported regime in Saigon. Ho, now in poor health, was reduced to a largely ceremonial role, while policy was shaped by others. On September 3, 1969, he died in Hanoi of heart failure. In his honor, after the Communist conquest of the South in 1975, Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City. Ho Chi Minh was not only the founder of Vietnamese communism, he was the very soul of the revolution and of Vietnam's struggle for independence. His personal qualities of simplicity, integrity, and determination were widely admired, not only within Vietnam but elsewhere as well.  </string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_HUS_PEDIA">[H1]Jan Hus[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Priest, philosopher, reformer, and master at Charles University in Prague[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c. 1369 - 1415[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Among the many, no doubt apocryphal, stories of Jan Hus's life is one that relates an incident in his youth, which foreshadowed his fate as a Christian martyr. According to the account, the youthful Hus was sitting beside a fire one winter evening reading about the martyrdom of St. Lawrence. Suddenly, he thrust his hand into the flames. When a fellow pupil pulled him away from the fire and questioned his intentions, Hus replied: \"I was only trying what part of the tortures of this holy man I might be capable of enduring.\"What truth, if any, there is in the story cannot be determined. But what is historical fact is that on July 6, 1415, condemned as an arch-heretic by the Council of Constance and turned over to the state for execution, Jan Hus sang a hymn as the flames engulfed his body in a meadow just outside the city walls of Constance. Hus was charged with propagating the heretical teachings of the late 14th-century English reformer John Wycliffe, \"the Morning Star of the Reformation,\" whose bones the Council of Constance ordered disinterred and burned. One hundred years later, Martin Luther was charged with heresy by the church hierarchy for espousing views associated with Hus and condemned as heresy by the Council of Constance. Therein lies the historical significance of Jan Hus. He was a vital link in the chain of reformers who sought to reform the late-medieval church, and whose efforts, often punctuated by martyrdom, culminated in the 16th-century Reformation.The period of the Renaissance church (roughly the mid-14th through 16th centuries) was, spiritually speaking, the bleakest chapter in Church history. In 1303, Pope Boniface VIII was taken captive by the French king Philip IV, and the papal court moved to Avignon in southern France. An attempt in 1378 to end the \"Babylonian Captivity\" and return the papal court to Rome led only to the election of two rival popes, one in Avignon and the other in Rome. Both were dominated by men who often made no pretense to spiritual interests. But as destructive as it was, the worldliness of the Renaissance popes did not damage the spiritual authority of the church nearly so much as the Great Schism, the scandal of two popes.According to the teachings of the medieval church, the pope, or bishop of Rome, was \"the vicar of Christ, the successor to St. Peter, the keeper of the keys, the servus servorum Dei, the servant of the servants of God.\" How then could the authority of Christ be divided? Only one of the two popes could be the true successor of St. Peter according to apostolic succession. The other had to be an antipope. But which was the pope and which was the antipope? And were the sacraments, held to be necessary for the salvation of the individual, valid if performed under the authority of the antipope?It is within the context of this crisis of faith within the late-medieval church that the life of Jan Hus must be considered. But it also must be viewed against the backdrop of imperial politics within the Holy Roman Empire and the emergence of Bohemian (or Czech) nationalism. The two are so closely intertwined that they cannot be separated. The cause of religious reform in Bohemia at the turn of the 15th century was also the cry of Bohemian nationalism within the Holy Roman Empire.The exact date of Jan Hus's birth cannot be determined. It has been variously given as the year 1369, 1372, 1373 or 1375. Popular legend placed the exact date as July 6, 1369, but July 6 is believed to be nothing more than an imaginative analogy with the date of his martyrdom. In any event, he was born in Husinec (meaning \"Goosetown\") in southern Bohemia on the border of Bavaria.In his youth, Jan Hus was known simply as \"Jan, son of Michael,\" since it was customary in Bohemia to identify a man by giving his Christian name and the name of his father. In the register of the University of Prague, he is inscribed as \"Jan of Husinec,\" or \"Jan from the village of Husinec.\" Between 1398 and 1400, he signed his name as \"Jan Hus,\" or \"Jan Hus of Husinec.\" After 1400, he always signed his name as simply \"Jan Hus.\" Thus he derived his last name \"Hus\" from the name of his birthplace, and his actual family name is lost to history.Of Jan Hus's family even less is known. It is assumed that his parents were humble people of peasant background. Nothing is known of his father, who apparently died when Jan was very young. His mother was a very pious woman. A casual mention in one of his surviving letters leads scholars to assume that Jan Hus had brothers, but nothing is known of them or any possible sisters.Jan Hus received his \"elementary\" schooling in the Latin school of the nearby town of Prachatice. When 18 years old, he enrolled at the University of Prague. From then until his death in 1415, his life and fate were shaped by the political and religious struggles that characterized this divided university. In 1393 or 1394, he received his bachelor's degree, and by 1396, his master of arts. That same year, he became a member of the faculty of arts at the university. At first, he lectured on the philosophy of the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle and the realist philosophy of John Wycliffe. While teaching, Hus also pursued theological studies and in 1404, he earned a bachelor of divinity degree. Three years later, he was in the process of earning his doctorate but never received it. Instead, he earned the martyr's crown.At what point in his life Jan Hus made the transition to a religious reformer is also unknown. He once commented that the reason he wanted to become a priest was \"to secure a good livelihood and dress and be held in esteem by men.\" During his early years at the university, he lived what he characterized as a lighthearted lifestyle. Hus nowhere records a \"conversion\" experience as do Martin Luther and other religious reformers. Rather, he simply states that \"when the Lord gave me knowledge of the Scriptures, I discarded from my foolish mind that kind of stupid fun making.\"Following his ordination in 1402, he was appointed rector and preacher of the Bethlehem Chapel in Prague. Founded in 1391, the Bethlehem Chapel was the point at which the Czech national movement coalesced with the cause of religious reform. Under the patronage of Charles IV, king of Bohemia, and his son Wenceslas IV, both of whom were also Holy Roman Emperors, Bethlehem Chapel was a refuge for a group of reform-minded Bohemian clergy, including John Milic of Kromerí and Matthew of Janov. They preached in the Czech language, rather than Latin, and hence were very popular with the common people.Jan Hus soon became the leader of the reform party centered in the Bethlehem Chapel and shared their condemnation of the corrupt clergy. Matthew of Janov characterized the priests as:worldly, proud, mercenary, pleasure-loving, and hypocritical. They do not regard their sins as such, do not allow themselves to be reproved, and persecute the saintly preachers. There is no doubt that if Jesus lived among such people, they would be the first to put him to death.Such outspoken opinions ran the risk of incurring the wrath of the church hierarchy. But so long as Hus and his associates enjoyed the protection of Wenceslas and Zybnek Zajic, the young reform-minded Archbishop of Prague, they were safe.What drew upon the reformers the charge of heresy was their acceptance of many of the theological teachings of John Wycliffe, a leading exponent of the philosophical position known as \"realism.\" Prior to 1401, Hus knew only Wycliffe's philosophical works, but this was enough to incur the enmity of the German-dominated faculty of the university, for they were committed to the opposite philosophical position, \"nominalism.\" The realists believed that universals have objective reality, whereas the nominalists held that universals or abstract concepts are mere names. For Wycliffe and his followers, this meant that in theology they emphasized the priority of faith over reason and the authority of the Scriptures (Bible) over church tradition.After the marriage of Wenceslas's half-sister Anne of Bohemia to Wycliffe's patron and defender, Richard II of England, a number of Bohemian students went to study under Wycliffe at Oxford University. As these students returned to the University of Prague, they brought with them the theological works of Wycliffe. Many of Wycliffe's views were congenial to the Bohemian reformers of the Bethlehem Chapel and accepted by them. Among them was Wycliffe's doctrine of the true Church. According to Wycliffe's understanding of Scripture, which he held to be authoritative, the true Church consisted of all thosepast, present, and futurepredestined by God to salvation. Since the Roman Catholic Church included both those predestined to salvation and those \"foreknown\" to damnation, it was not, as it believed itself to be, the true body of Christ. Hence, Wycliffe rejected the divine origin of the Roman Catholic Church and the alleged authority of the pope.Wycliffe also advocated \"territorial churches, each protected, regulated, and supported by the territorial lords and princes.\" There was, of course, much more to Wycliffe's theological teaching, but the attraction it held for the Bohemians trying to liberate themselves from German cultural domination should be clear. Likewise, the connection with the 16th-century Reformation is clear. The fundamental doctrines of the Protestant Reformation are present in Wycliffe's teaching, and hence that of Hus, also.Jan Hus did not accept carte blanche all that Wycliffe taught. He did not, for example, accept Wycliffe's doctrine of remanence with respect to the Eucharist, or Mass. The doctrine of remanence held that in the celebration of the Eucharist, the bread and wine retain their material substance. Thus it denied the alleged miracle of transubstantiation by which, according to the Roman Catholic Church, the bread and wine became the flesh and blood of Christ. Transubstantiation was the key to the whole edifice of medieval theology. Remove it, and one removed the need for the priesthood and the medieval institutional church as it then existed.Although Hus did not agree with all that Wycliffe taught, and which his associates at Bethlehem Chapel and the university were teaching, he refused to denounce those views which he did not hold. The Bohemian party at the university was locked in a struggle with the German party for control of that institution. The Germans soon realized that their most effective way of countering the Bohemian party was to focus on its Wycliffism. Many of Wycliffe's teachings had been condemned by Pope Gregory XI and the English prelates, although Wycliffe died officially orthodox (\"conforming to established doctrine\").In 1403, Johann Hübner, one of the German masters at the university, drew up a list of 45 articles from Wycliffe's writings. Among them were the doctrine of remanence and the teaching that the Bible is the sole source of Christian doctrine. Hübner was able to have the 45 articles condemned as heresy. As they became a test of orthodoxy at the university, Hus was in danger of being branded a heretic and soon lost the support of both Archbishop Zbynek and King Wenceslas, although for different reasons. The change of events grew out of efforts to end the Great Schism.Wenceslas and the king of France (Charles VI) sought to end the Great Schism by convening a church council in Pisa in 1409. The Council deposed both Gregory XII (Rome) and Benedict XIII (Avignon), and elected Alexander VI, who was succeeded in 1410 by John XXIII. Since neither of the former two resigned, the number of popes was merely increased by one.The Council of Pisa and its aftermath sealed Hus's fate. Hus supported Wenceslas and recognized Alexander VI as pope. Zbynek and the German masters at the University of Prague refused to do so. When many of the German masters chose to leave Prague to found a new university at Leipzig in Germany, Zybnek began to take a closer look at Hus's teachings.In 1410, Archbishop Zybnek confiscated Wycliffe's books and ordered them burned. When Hus defended the books, Zybnek excommunicated him, and the following year Hus was ordered to appear in Rome. Refusing to go, Hus was excommunicated for disobedience. Having lost the support of his onetime ally, the Archbishop, Hus would next lose the support of his King.John XXIII proclaimed a crusade against King Ladislas of Naples, a supporter of John XXIII's rival, Gregory XII. The cost of the crusade was to be paid for by the sale of indulgences in, among other areas, Bohemia. Since Wenceslas was to receive a portion of the income from the sale of indulgences, he supported the crusade. Hus, however, openly condemned both and accused John XXIII of \"trafficking in sacred things.\" Such action cost him and his associates the support of Wenceslas. Shortly thereafter, three members of the reform party who spoke out against indulgences were arrested and beheaded.In September 1412, a papal bull of excommunication of Hus was published in Prague. The city was placed under an interdict, and Bethlehem Chapel closed. An interdict was still a powerful weapon against heretics or other enemies of the church hierarchy. An area under interdict was denied the sacraments: \"All masses and sermons, all religious functions, even burial with the Christian rites were prohibited.\" It was intended to turn the people of an area against the onein this case Huswho was defying the church authorities. To spare the city the rigors of being under an interdict, Hus withdrew from Prague and took refuge with various Bohemian nobles.The final act of Hus's life was played out at the Council of Constance (1414-18), called to bring an end to the Great Schism and to deal with the problem of heresy, especially Hus. Zygmunt, the king of Hungary and brother of Wenceslas, was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1410. To strengthen his position in Germany, he pressured John XXIII to call the Council. Then, in the spring of 1415, offering a guarantee of safe conduct, Zygmunt invited Hus to attend. At first Hus hesitated, but with the urging of Wenceslas, he accepted.Once in Constance, Hus was lured into the papal residence, then imprisoned in a Dominican dungeon. What followed were months of interrogation and suffering. Zygmunt withdrew his safe conduct in January 1415. It was only due to great pressure exerted by Bohemian noblemen that Hus was given any semblance of a public hearing on June 5, 7, and 8, but he was not allowed to respond to the charges made against him. Presented with a list of 30 articles allegedly drawn from his writings but in fact drawn from the writings of John Wycliffe, Hus was ordered to renounce them upon oath. He refused, unless instructed from Scripture as to where his teachings were in error. The Council rejected his appeal to the Bible as a superior authority.On July 6, Hus was given a final opportunity to recant. Again he refused, saying that since he did not hold all of the views as stated, to recant would be to commit perjury. He was then declared an arch-heretic and a disciple of Wycliffe. He was ceremoniously degraded from the priest-hood, his soul was consigned to the devil, and he was turned over to the secular authorities for execution. That same day, he was led to a meadow outside the city wall and burned alive.Although the Council had consigned his soul to the devil, Hussinging loudly as the flames consumed him consigned his soul to God: \"Jesus Christ! The Son of the living God! Have mercy upon me.\" His ashes were then gathered up and cast into the Rhine River.</string>

As vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, Saddam tightly controlled conflict between the government and the armed forces - at a time when many other groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government - by creating repressive security forces. In the early 1970s, Saddam spearheaded Iraq's nationalization of the Western-owned Iraq Petroleum Company, which had long held a monopoly on the country's oil. Through the 1970s, Saddam cemented his authority over the apparatuses of government as Iraq's economy grew at a rapid pace.[PARAGRAPH:1]As president, Saddam maintained power during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) and the first Persian Gulf War (1991). During these conflicts, Saddam repressed movements he considered threatening to the stability of Iraq, particularly Shi'a and Kurdish movements seeking to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively. Whereas some Arabs looked upon him as a hero for his aggressive stance against foreign intervention and for his support for the Palestinians, United States leaders continued to view Saddam with deep suspicion following the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Saddam was deposed by the U.S. and its allies during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[PARAGRAPH:1]Saddam saw himself as a social revolutionary and a modernizer, following the Nasser model. To the consternation of Islamic conservatives, his government gave women added freedoms and offered them high-level government and industry jobs. Saddam also created a Western-style legal system, making Iraq the only country in the Persian Gulf region not ruled according to traditional Islamic law (Sharia). Saddam abolished the Sharia law courts, except for personal injury claims.[PARAGRAPH:1]As a sign of his consolidation of power, Saddam's personality cult pervaded Iraqi society. Thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals were erected in his honor all over Iraq. His face could be seen on the sides of office buildings, schools, airports, and shops, as well as on Iraqi currency. Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. He appeared in the costumes of the Bedouin, the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even Kurdish clothing, but also appeared in Western suits, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader. Sometimes he would also be portrayed as a devout Muslim, wearing full headdress and robe, praying toward Mecca.[PARAGRAPH:1]Captured by U.S. forces on December 13, 2003, Saddam was brought to trial under the Iraqi interim government set up by U.S.-led forces. On November 5, 2006, he was convicted of charges related to the executions of 148 Iraqi Shi'ites suspected of planning an assassination attempt against him, and was sentenced to death by hanging. Saddam was executed on December 30, 2006.</string>

He was born in Volubilis (Morocco) two months after the death of his father. Idris II was the great great grandchild of Hassan, son of Ali the cousin of the prophet Muhammad.[PARAGRAPH:1]The death of Idris I, and the resulting destabilisation of the fledgling Idrisid dynasty state, delighted the Caliph in Baghdad. However, two months later, a concubine of Idris I gave birth to Idris II, who became a quick prodigy.[PARAGRAPH:1]In reference to Idris II, the historian Rom Landau, says: \"In the lore of the Moroccans, Idris II was a being of almost magical attributes. An exceptional young man he certainly must have been. At many points we are reminded of one of the greatest sages of Islam, Ibn Sina or Avicenna. At the age of four little Idris apparently could read, at five write, at eight he knew the Koran by heart, and by then is said to have mastered the wisdom of all the outstanding savants. He was of real physical strength as well, and when he became officially sovereign in 805 at the age of thirteen, he had already accomplished feats of endurance that men twice his age could not emulate. His profound Islamic faith enhanced all these advantages and increased the veneration accorded him.\"[PARAGRAPH:1]Twenty years after his father had done so, Idris II refounded the city Fez on the left bank of the river Fez, opposite to where his father had founded it on the right bank. From there on, Idris II began to unify Maghreb under Islam, establishing its firm allegiance to the belief. After spending 19 years pursuing such purposes, this prodigy died at 35 in 828. For twelve hundred years afterwards, the tradition of monarchy, established by Idris I and II, were continued.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_ITHOBAAL_PEDIA">[H1]Ithobaal I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Tyre[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c. 915 - 847 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Ithobaal I (or Ethbaal; Biblical Ethbaal, 1 Kings 16:31) was a king of Tyre who founded a new dynasty. During his reign, Tyre expanded its power on the mainland, making all of Phoenicia its territory as far north as Beirut, including Sidon, and even a part of the island of Cyprus. At the same time, Tyre also built new overseas colonies: Botrys (now Batrun) near Byblos, and Auza in Libya.Primary information related to Ithobaal comes from Josephuss citation of the Phoenician author Menander of Ephesus, in Against Apion i.18. Here it is said that the previous king, Phelles, was slain by Ithobalus, the priest of Astarte, who reigned thirty-two years, and lived sixty-eight years; he was succeeded by his son Badezorus (Baal-Eser II).  The dates given here are according to the work of F. M. Cross and other scholars who take 825 BC as the date of Didos flight from her brother Pygmalion, after which she founded the city of Carthage in 814 BC. See the chronological justification for these dates in the Pygmalion article.Ithobaal held close diplomatic contacts with king Ahab of Israel. First Kings 16:31 relates that his daughter Jezebel married Ahab (874  853 BC), and Phoenician influence in Samaria and the other Israelite cities was extensive. In the 1 Kings passage, Ithobaal is labeled king of the Sidonians. At this time Tyre and Sidon were consolidated into one kingdom.  Menanders comment that Ithobaal had been a priest of Astarte before becoming king explains why his daughter Jezebel was so zealous in the promotion of idolatry, thus leading to the conflicts between Elijah and Jezebels forces described in 1 Kings 18 and 19.  Menanders further statement that her father was a murderer sheds some light on her choice of a way to solve the Naboth problem in 1 Kings 21.  Tyre is not mentioned as an opponent of Shalmaneser III at the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC, but twelve years later, in 841, Ithobaals son Baal-Eser II gave tribute to the Assyrian monarch.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_JEZEBEL_PEDIA">[H1]Jezebel[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Princess of Phoenicia, Queen of Israel[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c.9th Century BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Jezebel was a Phoenician princess, identified in the Hebrew Book of Kings as the daughter of Ethbaal, King of the Sidonians (Phoenicians) and the wife of Ahab, king of north Israel. According to genealogies given in Josephus and other classical sources she was the great aunt of Dido, Queen of Carthage.The Hebrew text portrays Jezebel as an evil power behind the throne. Ahab and Jezebel allow temples of Baal to operate in Israel, and that religion receives royal patronage. After Ahab's death, his sons by Jezebel, Ahaziah and Jehoram, accede to the throne. The prophet Elisha has one of his servants anoint Jehu as king to overthrow the house of Ahab. Jehu kills Jehoram as he attempts to flee in his war chariot. He then confronts Jezebel in Jezreel and urges her eunuchs to kill the queen mother by throwing her out of a window and leaving her corpse in the street to be eaten by dogs. Only Jezebel's skull, feet, and hands remain. Jezebel's final act, equipping herself in all her finery before she is murdered, has led to her being represented as a kind of prostitute.Jezebel's story is told in 1st and 2nd Kings.  The story concerns an intense religious-political struggle  the most detailed such account of any period in the history of the Kingdom of Israel   written from a highly partisan point of view, with no surviving documents to represent the other side of the controversy. The account is mainly interested in the religious side of the events, with the political, economic and social background  highly important to modern historiansgiven only incidentally.  She is introduced as a Phoenician princess, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Phoenician empire and marries King Ahab of the Northern Kingdom (i.e. Israel during the time when ancient Israel was divided into Israel in the north and Judah in the south). She helps convert Ahab from worship of the Jewish God to worship of the Phoenician god Baal. After she has many Jewish prophets killed, Elijah challenges 450 prophets of Baal to a competition (1 Kings 18), exposes the rival god as powerless and goes on to have prophets of Baal slaughtered (1 Kings 18:40), thereby incurring Jezebel's furious enmity.  To Barzowski, Ahab's marriage to Jezebel was  at least to begin with  obviously a dynastic marriage intended to cement a Phoenician alliance, going back to the times of King Solomon, that gave the inland Kingdom of Israel access to international trade. The monarchy (and possibly an urban elite connected with it) enjoyed the wealth derived from this trade, which gave it a stronger position vis-a-vis the rural landowners and made for a more centralized and powerful monarchical administration.  The story of Naboth, a landowner who was killed at the instigation of Jezebel so that the King could acquire his land, certainly points in this direction  Jezebel, with her foreign religion and cosmopolitan culture, representing a hated Phoenician alliance from which the landowners had little to gain and much to lose. Their resentment was expressed in religious terms (as in many other times and places), and eventually got a political expression in Jehu's bloody coup, instigated and supported by the prophets whose side of the story the Bible preserves.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_JINNAH_PEDIA">[H1]Mohammad Ali Jinnah[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Governor-General of Pakistan[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1876 - 1948[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The eldest son of a hide merchant, Jinnah was educated at the Sind Madrassa and Lincoln's Inn, London, where he qualified as a barrister. The future founder of Pakistan was first known as the ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. Indeed Jinnah only resigned from Congress in 1920 when he became disillusioned with the violence and communal passions unleashed by Gandhi's Congress-Khilafat civil disobedience campaigns. The division widened in 1928 when the Nehru Report rejected Jinnah's \"fourteen points\" constitutional proposals.  During 1921  35, Jinnah's political career was in the doldrums. He returned to India in October 1935 after a five-year British exile to reorganize the Muslim League. It nevertheless lost heavily in the 1937 provincial elections. The Congress ministries' insensitivity to Muslim demands rescued it from oblivion, although Jinnah's leadership was equally crucial to its dramatic transformation. From 1940 onwards, he propounded the two-nation theory justification for Pakistan and increasingly embodied the aspirations of the Indian Muslim community which acclaimed him as the Quaid-i-Azam, the great leader. Within the fractious politics of the Muslim League, he exerted an unquestioned moral authority which underpinned his formal power as President. Simultaneously he deployed his forensic skills in the complex constitutional negotiations with the British and the Congress.  Jinnah's successful claim to be the sole spokesman of Muslim India at the July 1945 Simla conference greatly strengthened the Pakistan demand. During 1946  7, however, he suffered a series of reversals as the Muslim League lost its wartime bargaining power. He had to abandon his strictly constitutional approach to politics, but the resulting communal riots threatened civil war. Agreement for Partition was finally reached on 3 June 1947: the Pakistan which emerged was not of the full six Muslim provinces of Jinnah's dreams, but a moth-eaten country shorn of West Bengal and East Punjab. Mass migrations and massacres accompanied the Punjab's partition. The refugee crisis increased Pakistan's formidable security and administrative problems.  Jinnah, who was both Pakistan's Governor-General and Constituent Assembly President, assumed much of the burden for laying the state's foundations. He was by now 70 and appeared frailer and more emaciated than ever. It remains doubtful however whether if he had lived longer than September 1948, Pakistan could have avoided its growing crisis of governability.  Jinnah is still revered as Pakistan's founding father. Islamists improbably and secularists more soundly have attempted to claim his mantle. Recent revisionist scholarship, however, has speculated that Partition was the unintended consequence of his trumpeting the Pakistan demand as a bargaining counter for power in a united India.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_JOGAILA_PEDIA">[H1]Jogaila[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Grand Duke of Lithuania, King of Poland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1362 - 1434 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Jogaila was born to Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Uliana, daughter of Alexander I, Grand Prince of Tver.  When Jogaila succeeded to the throne in 1377, Lithuania contained two different nationalities and two political systems: ethnic Lithuania in the northwest and the vast Ruthenian territories of the former Kievan Rus', comprising lands of modern Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of western Russia.  At first, Jogaila based his rule in southern and eastern territories in Lithuania, while his uncle continued to rule the northwestern region. [PARAGRAPH: 1] At the beginning of his reign, Jogaila confronted unrest in the Lithuanian Rus' lands.  In the northwest, Lithuania faced constant thread from the monastic state of the Teutonic Order, which was founded in 1226 to fight and convert the pagan Baltic tries of Prussians, Yotvingians, and Lithuanians.  In return for the Order's backing against Jogaila's uncle, Jogaila agreed to the Christianization of Lithuania.  However, Jogaila's uncle discovered the plan, seized Vilnius, overthrew Jogaila, and pronounced himself Grand Duke in his place.  Jogaila's uncle, with the help of his son Vytautas, entered Jogaila's encampment in Vilnius.  The uncle was later murdered, and Vytautas escaped.  Jogaila conducted further talks with the Teutonic Order, but later was betrayed by them.  Jogaila then allied himself with Vytautas to, in retaliation, loot and attack several Prussian castles. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Jogaila's choice to marry a Christian wife was evident, and he therefore married the young Queen Jadwiga of Poland.  Jogaila also signed a treaty with Poland agreeing to his Christianization and the returning of the lands taken from Poland by its neighbors.  Another agreement concerning a union between Lithuania and Poland was also signed when the marriage took place.  When Jogaila was baptized in 1386, Lithuania's Christianization began. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Jogaila and Jadwiga reigned as co-monarchs, and Jadwiga made several contributions to Poland's political and cultural life.  Jogaila then passed several laws unifying the two legal systems of Poland and Lithuania that achieved a lasting influence on history.  During the following years, he faced continuous challenges.  The Teutonic Knights failed to end their crusades claiming Jogaila's conversion to Christianity was false.  Jogaila and Jadwiga sponsored the creation of the Diocese of Vilnius and other religious reforms.  Jogaila faced a revived challenge from Vytautas, who resented the power given to Skirgaila in Lithuania at the expense of his own patrimony.  In 1390, Vytautas and the Teutonic Knights laid siege to Vilnius and destroyed the outer city.  In order to gain peace with Vytautas, Jogaila handed over the throne of Lithuania to him.  However, Vytautas continued to demand Lithuania's separation from Poland.  Later, after being crushed by the Timurids in a battle, Vytautas was forced to give in to Jogaila's protection once again. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In 1399, Jadwiga died while giving birth, leaving Jogaila the sole ruler of Poland without an heir.  In 1401, Vytautas was recognized as Grand Duke under Jogaila's overlordship, also allowing Jogaila's heirs, rather than those of Vytautas, to succeed to the throne.  If no heirs were born, the Lithuanian boyars would elect a new monarch.  This act forged an alliance between Poland and Lithuania, strengthening both for another war against the Teutonic Order.  However, after problems within borders, Jogaila was defeated after a war with the Teutonic Order, and gave in to their demands.  In 1408, Jogaila and Vytautas held strategic talks in Navahrudak, where they decided to revolt against Teutonic rule in portions of Lithuania.  The Order declared war against Poland that same year. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The castles on the northern border were easily captured by the Teutonic Knights, and both sides prepared for a major confrontation that winter.  Both sides received support from various European countries.  However, after one of the largest and most ferocious battles of the Middle Ages, Jogaila and his army were victors.  Jogaila, however, hesitated to move on to the capital of Marienburg, and thus suffered a loss at the city.  The war ended in 1411 in which neither Poland nor Lithuania returned home with all of what they hoped to earn.  Lithuania regained much of its territory after the war, but the Polish people began to revive their distrust of Jogaila.  Jogaila made several attempts to strengthen his relations with the Polish people, including permanently forming a union between Poland and Lithuania. [PARAGRAPH: 1] A new war broke out between the Knights and Poland, but ended in nothing, as both sides were still worn out from the last war.  Jogaila continued to be questioned and scandalized by his people, and lost the popularity he once had.  In 1422, Jogaila fought another war against the Teutonic Order, defeating them in under two months.  Further sporadic wars broke out between Poland and the Knights between 1431 and 1435.  Jogaila died in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son and Lithuania to his younger, both were minors at the time.</string>

When Kamehameha was born, Halley's Comet was visible in Hawaii.  Kamehameha's birth name was Pai'ea, and he was born to Keku'iapoiwa, chief of the Kohala on the island of Hawai'i, and to Keoua.  Keoua, his father, was the son of Keaweikekahiali'iokamoku, who was the chief of a large portion of Hawai'i.  However, after his reign a war over succession broke, and Alapa'i emerged victorious over his brothers and their sons, including Keoua.  When Kamehameha was born, Alapa'i ordered that he be killed, and was nervous at the thought that the child might eventually rule over Hawai'i.  So, Kamehameha was given to another noble, Nae'ole, and thus disappeared from sight.  Alapa'i, in remorse for his actions, invited the child to live in the royal court. [PARAGRAPH: 1] When Alapa'i died, he was succeeded by his son Keawea'opala who was challenged by Kalani'opu'u, Alapa'i's great nephew, and was backed by Kamehameha.  At a battle at Kealakekua Bay, Keawea'opala was victorious and made Kamehameha his aid.  In 1779, on a trip with Kalani'opu'u to Kealakekua Bay, Kamehameha met Captain Cook.  Cook was mistaken to be the Hawaiian god of fertility, Lono, and Kamehameha may have been onboard his ship for some time.  After Kalani'opu'u's death, kingship was inherited by his son Kiwala'o.  Kamehameha was still given a prominent position, but there was a conflict between the two cousins.  When a group of chiefs offered Kamehameha the kingship instead of Kiwala'o, he accepted and later defeated Kiwala'o at the Battle of Moku'ohai. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In 1790, Kamehameha deposed the chief of the district of Puna, Keawema'uhili.  At the same time Keoua, exiled to his home, led an uprising.  However, a third of his warriors were killed when he fled from the returning Kamehameha past a volcano. Kamehameha built a temple to sacrifice Keoua later, so that Kamehameha became the chief of all of Hawai'i. Kamehameha had other ambitions, and sought the help from British and American traders, who sold guns and ammunition to Kamehameha.  When Kamehameha invaded the weakened islands of Maui and O'ahu, he did not think that his rival, Kalanikupule, also possessed firearms. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In 1795, Kamehameha set sail with an astonishing 1,200 war canoes and 10,000 soldiers.  He quickly captured the islands of Maui and Moloka'i, and then moved on to O'ahu.  However, one of Kamehameha's best commanders defected to Kalanikupule.  In a series of skirmishes, Kamehameha and his army pushed back Kalanukupule until he was trapped.  After Kamehameha's troops faced heavy cannon fire advancing to Kalanikupule, he sent his best warriors to attack the cannons from behind, which proved to be successful.  Thus, Kalanikupule's troops fell into disarray and were defeated, with Kalanikupule being sacrificed later. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Kamehameha was now the complete ruler of all of Hawai'i east of O'ahu, but the islands of Kaua'i and Ni'ihau were continuously escaping him.  Kamehameha's first invasion was unsuccessful, and his second resulted in disease.  After being intimidated by Kamehameha's new strong army, Kaumali'i, chief of Kaua'i, agreed to become a vassal of Kamehameha.  As the first king of Hawaii, Kamehameha made several steps to make certain that the islands remained united after his death.  He unified the legal system and didn't allow non-Hawaiians to own land.  This proclamation guaranteed the islands' independence while other islands in the Pacific gave in to colonial authority. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Kamehameha also instituted the Mamalohoe Kanawi, the Law of the Splintered Paddle.  This law had origins in Kamehameha's early battles.  The Law provided the safety of noncombatants during wartime, and remains in Hawaii's state constitution today, being its first law.  When Kamehameha died in 1819, his body was trusted to his friend, Haopili.  To this day, his resting place remains unknown.</string>

He was there in 1808 when local Fulbe rose against Bornu rule, emulating Usman Dan Fodio's \"Fulani jihad\" which created the Sokoto Caliphate to the west in Hausaland. While these forces took the capital of Gazargamu, elements of the Bornu state fought on and expelled the raiders. Al-Kanemi's community was one such resistant, and al-Kanemi was given credit, although he led by planning, inspiration, and prayer. He attracted a following, especially from networks Shuwa Arab and Kanembu communities extending far outside Bornu's borders. The Mai (Ruler), Dunama IX Lefiami rewarded the leader with control over a Bornu province on the Western march. Taking only the title \"Shehu\" (\"Sheikh\"), and eschewing the traditional offices, al-Kanemi gathered a powerful following, becoming both the voice of Bornu in negotiations with Sokoto, as well as a semi independent ruler of a trade rich area with a powerful military. Dunama was deposed by his uncle in 1809, but the support of al-Kanemi brought him back to power in 1813.  Al-Kanemi carried on a series of theological, legal and political debates by letter with the Sultan of Sokoto Usman dan Fodio, and later with his son, Muhammed Bello. As the expansion of Sokoto was predicated upon a struggle against paganism, apostasy, and misrule, al-Kanemi challenged the right of his neighbors to strike at a state which had been Muslim for at least 800 years. These debates, often on the nature of Jihad and Muslim rule, remain points of contention in modern Nigeria.  Al-Kanemi, not just the face of Bornu to foreign leaders, became more and more indispensable to the Mai. Some in Dunama's coterie were believed to have been behind an attempt to kill the Shehu in 1820. Open fighting resulted in the death of the Mai, and al-Kanemi, while still titular subject of the new Mai, had his own seals struck as Shehu of all Bornu.  The Shehu had constructed in 1814 a power base at the new city of Kukawa, and this became the de facto capitol of Bornu. Sayfawa mais remained titular monarchs after al-Kameni's 1836/7 death. In 1846 the last mai, in league with the Ouaddai Empire, precipitated a civil war, resisted by the Shehu and al-Kanemi's son, Umar. It was at that point that Umar (1837-1881) became sole ruler, thus ending one of the longest dynastic reigns in African history.</string>

Kekkonen continued the \"active neutrality\" policy of President Juho Kusti Paasikivi, which came to be known as the Paasikivi-Kekkonen Line. This policy allowed Finland to live with both the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Warsaw Pact. Kekkonen was the longest-serving president of Finland.[PARAGRAPH:1]Throughout his time as president, Kekkonen did his best to keep political rivals in check. The Centre Party's rival, National Coalition Party was kept in opposition despite good performance in elections. On a few occasions, the parliament was dissolved as the political composition did not please Kekkonen. Too prominent Centre Party members often found themselves sidelined, as Kekkonen negotiated directly with the lower lever. The \"Mill Letters\" of Kekkonen were a continuous stream of directives to high officials, politicians, journalists etc.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the 1960s Kekkonen was responsible for a number of foreign-policy initiatives, involving for example the Nordic nuclear-free zone, the border agreement with Norway and a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1969. The purpose of these initiatives was to avoid the enforcement of the military articles in the FCMA treaty - in other words, military co-operation between Finland and the Soviet Union - and thus to strengthen Finland's attempt to practice a policy of neutrality. Following the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 pressure for neutrality increased. Kekkonen informed the Soviets in 1970 that he would not continue as president, nor would the FCMA treaty be extended, if the Soviet Union was no longer prepared to recognise Finland's neutrality.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kekkonen was re-elected normally in 1968. In 1973, he was re-elected by emergency law which saw his presidency extended by four years. The elimination of any significant opposition and competition meant de facto political autocracy for Kekkonen. The year 1975 can be regarded as marking the zenith of his power, when he dissolved parliament and hosted the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki with the assistance of a caretaker government. In the 1978 Presidential election, with Kekkonen's candidacy being supported by the Social Democratic, Centre and National Coalition parties, there were no serious rivals left. Kekkonen won 259 out of the 300 electoral college votes, with his nearest rival, Raino Westerholm of the Christian Union. receiving 24.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1979 Urho Kekkonen was awarded Lenin Peace Prize.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_KOSSUTH_PEDIA">[H1]Lajos Kussoth[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Governor-President of Hungary[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1802 - 1894 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Shortly after his dismissal by Countess Szapáry, Kossuth was appointed as deputy to Count Hunyady at the National Diet. The Diet met during 18251827 and 18321836 in Pressburg, then capital of Hungary. Only the upper aristocracy could vote, however, and Kossuth took little part in the debates. At the time, a struggle to reassert a Hungarian national identity was beginning to emerge under able leaders  most notably Wesselényi and the Széchenyis. In part, this was also a struggle for reform against the stagnant Austrian government. Kossuth's duties to Count Hunyady included reporting on Diet proceedings in writing, as the Austrian government, fearing popular dissent, had banned published reports. The high quality of Kossuth's letters led to their being circulated in manuscript among other Liberal magnates. Readership demands turned his output into the editing of an organized parliamentary gazette; spreading his name and influence further. Orders from the Official Censor halted circulation by lithograph printing. Distribution in manuscript by post was forbidden by the government, although circulation by hand continued.  In 1836 the Diet was dissolved. Kossuth continued to report, covering the debates of the county assemblies. This new-found publicity gave the assemblies national political prominence. Previously they had had little idea of each others' proceedings. His skilful embellishment of the speeches from the Liberals and Reformers further enhanced the impact of his newsletters. The government in vain attempted to suppress the letters, and other means having failed, he was in May 1837, with Wesselényi and several others, arrested on a charge of high treason. After spending a year in prison at Buda awaiting trial, he was condemned to four more years' imprisonment. His strict confinement damaged his health, but he was allowed to read. He greatly increased his political knowledge, and also acquired, from the study of the Bible and Shakespeare, a thorough knowledge of English.  The arrests had caused great indignation. The Diet, which reconvened in 1839, demanded the release of the prisoners, and refused to pass any government measures. Metternich long remained obdurate, but the danger of war in 1840 obliged him to give way. Wesselényi had been broken by his imprisonment, but Kossuth, partly supported by the frequent visits of Teresa Meszleny, emerged from prison unbroken. Immediately after his release Kossuth and Meszleny were married, and she remained a firm supporter of his politics. The Roman Catholic priests refused to bless the marriage as Kossuth would not convert to Meszleny's religion. This experience influenced Kossuth's firm defense of mixed marriages.Kossuth had now become a national icon. He regained full health in January 1841 and was appointed editor of Pesti Hírlap, a new Liberal party newspaper. Notably, the government agreed to grant a license. The paper achieved unprecedented success, soon reaching the then immense circulation of 7000 copies. A competing pro-government newspaper, Világ, started up, but it only served to increase Kossuth's visibility and add to the general political fervor.  Széchenyi, the great reformer, publicly warned Kossuth that his appeals to the passions of the people would lead the nation to revolution. Kossuth, undaunted, did not stop at the publicly reasoned reforms demanded by all Liberals: the abolition of entail, the abolition of feudal burdens and taxation of the nobles. He went on to broach the possibility of separating from Austria. By combining this nationalism with an insistence on the superiority of the Magyars to the Slavonic inhabitants of Hungary, he sowed the seeds of both the collapse of Hungary in 1849 and his own political demise.  In 1844, Kossuth was dismissed from Pesti Hírlap after a dispute with the proprietor over salary. It is believed that the dispute was rooted in government intrigue. Kossuth was unable to obtain permission to start his own newspaper. In a personal interview, Metternich offered to take him into the government service. Kossuth refused and spent the next three years without a regular position. He continued to agitate on behalf of both political and commercial independence for Hungary. He adopted the economic principles of List, and was the founder of a \"Védegylet\" society  whose members consumed only Hungarian produce. He also argued for the creation of a Hungarian port at Fiume.  In autumn 1847, Kossuth was able to take his final key step. Due to the support of Lajos Batthyány during a keenly fought campaign, he was elected to the new Diet as member for Pest. He proclaimed: \"Now that I am a deputy, I will cease to be an agitator.\" He immediately became chief leader of the Extreme Liberals. Ferenc Deák was absent. Batthyány, István Széchenyi, Szemere and József Eötvös, his political rivals, felt that his personal ambition and egoism led him to assume the chief place, and to use his parliamentary position to establish himself as leader of the nation; but before his eloquence and energy all apprehensions were useless. His eloquence was of that nature, in its impassioned appeals to the strongest emotions, that it required for its full effect the highest themes and the most dramatic situations. In a time of rest, though he could never have been obscure, he would never have attained the highest power. It was therefore a necessity of his nature, perhaps unconsciously, always to drive things to a crisis.The crisis came, and he used it to the full. On March 3, 1848, shortly after the news of the revolution in Paris had arrived, in a speech of surpassing power he demanded parliamentary government for Hungary and constitutional government for the rest of Austria. He appealed to the hope of the Habsburgs, \"our beloved Archduke Franz Joseph,\" to perpetuate the ancient glory of the dynasty by meeting half-way the aspirations of a free people. He at once became the leader of the European revolution; his speech was read aloud in the streets of Vienna to the mob by which Metternich was overthrown, and when a deputation from the Diet visited Vienna to receive the assent of Emperor Ferdinand to their petition it was Kossuth who received the chief ovation. Batthyány, who formed the first responsible government, appointed Kossuth the Minister of Finance.  With amazing energy he began developing the internal resources of the country: re-establishing a separate Hungarian coinage, and using every means to increase national self-consciousness. Characteristically, the new Hungarian bank notes had Kossuth's name as the most prominent inscription; making reference to \"Kossuth Notes\" a future byword. A new paper was started, to which was given the name of Kossuth Hirlapja, so that from the first it was Kossuth rather than the Palatine or prime minister Batthyány whose name was in the minds of the people associated with the new government. Much more was this the case when, in the summer, the dangers from the Croats, Serbs and the reaction at Vienna increased. In a great speech July 11 he asked that the nation should arm in self-defense, and demanded 200,000 men; amid a scene of wild enthusiasm this was granted by acclamation. However, the danger had been exacerbated by Kossuth himself, through appealing exclusively to the Magyar notables rather than the other subject minorities of the Habsburg Empire. The Austrians, meanwhile, successfully used the other minorities as allies against the Magyar uprising.  Kossuth's interpretation of the role of the non-Hungarian ethnic groups - as recounted in his speeches - was that Habsburg sympathizers \"stirred up the Wallachian peasants to take up arms against their own constitutional rights ... aided by the rebellious Servian hordes.\" These communities duly \"commenced a course of Vandalism and extinction, sparing neither women, children, nor aged men; murdering and torturing the defenseless Hungarian inhabitants; burning the most flourishing villages and towns.\"  While Croatian ban Josip Jelacic was marching on Pest, Kossuth went from town to town rousing the people to the defense of the country, and the popular force of the Honvéd was his creation. When Batthyány resigned he was appointed with Szemere to carry on the government provisionally, and at the end of September he was made President of the Committee of National Defense.  From this time he had increased amounts of power. The direction of the whole government was in his hands. Without military experience, he had to control and direct the movements of armies; he was unable to keep control over the generals or to establish that military co-operation so essential to success. Arthur Görgey in particular, whose great abilities Kossuth was the first to recognize, refused obedience; the two men were very different personalities. Twice Kossuth deposed him from the command; twice he had to restore him. It would have been well if Kossuth had had something more of Görgey's calculated ruthlessness, for, as has been truly said, the revolutionary power he had seized could only be held by revolutionary means (by which it is usually meant, revolutions can only be effected by dictatorship, repression and bloodshed); but he was by nature soft-hearted and always merciful; though often audacious, he lacked decision in dealing with men. It has been said that he showed a want of personal courage; this is not improbable, the excess of feeling which made him so great an orator could hardly be combined with the coolness in danger required of a soldier; but no one was able, as he was, to infuse courage into others.  During all the terrible winter which followed, his energy and spirit never failed him. It was he who overcame the reluctance of the army to march to the relief of Vienna; after the defeat of Schwechat, at which he was present, he sent Bem to carry on the war in Transylvania. At the end of the year, when the Austrians were approaching Pest, he asked for the mediation of Mr. Stiles, the American envoy. Windisch-Graetz, however, refused all terms, and the Diet and government fled to Debrecen, Kossuth taking with him the Crown of St Stephen, the sacred emblem of the Hungarian nation. In November 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in favor of Franz Joseph. The new Emperor revoked all the concessions granted in March and outlawed Kossuth and the Hungarian government - set up lawfully on the basis of the April laws. In April 1849, when the Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding the army, he issued the celebrated declaration of Hungarian independence, in which he declared that \"the house of Habsburg-Lorraine, perjured in the sight of God and man, had forfeited the Hungarian throne.\" It was a step characteristic of his love for extreme and dramatic action, but it added to the dissensions between him and those who wished only for autonomy under the old dynasty, and his enemies did not scruple to accuse him of aiming for Kingship. The dethronement also made any compromise with the Habsburgs practically impossible.  For the time the future form of government was left undecided, and Kossuth was appointed regent-president (to satisfy both royalists and republicans). Kossuth played a key role in tying down the Hungarian army for weeks for the siege and recapture of Buda castle, finally successful on 4 May 1849. The hopes of ultimate success were, however, frustrated by the intervention of Russia; all appeals to the western powers were vain, and on August 11 Kossuth abdicated in favor of Görgey, on the ground that in the last extremity the general alone could save the nation. Görgey capitulated at Világos to the Russians, who handed over the army to the Austrians. Görgey was spared  at the insistence of the Russians. Reprisals were taken on the rest of the Hungarian army. Kossuth steadfastly maintained until his death that Görgey alone was responsible for the humiliation.  Kossuth's time in power was at an end. A solitary fugitive, he crossed the Ottoman frontier. He was hospitably received by the Ottoman authorities, who, supported by the British, refused, notwithstanding the threats of the allied emperors, to surrender him and other fugitives to Austria. In January 1850 he was removed from Vidin, where he had been kept under house arrest, to Shumla, and thence to Kütahya in Asia Minor. Here he was joined by his children, who had been confined at Pressburg (present day Bratislava); his wife had joined him earlier, having escaped in disguise.</string>

He gained international renown as the face of Boer resistance against the British during the South African or Second Boer War (1899-1902).[PARAGRAPH:1]In time, Kruger emerged as a leader. He started as a field cornet in the commandos, eventually becoming Commandant-General of the South African Republic. He was appointed member of a commission of the Volksraad, the republican parliament that was to draw up a constitution. People began to take notice of the young man and he played a prominent part in ending the quarrel between the Transvaal leader, Stephanus Schoeman, and M.W. Pretorius.[PARAGRAPH:1]The First Boer War started in 1880, and the Boer forces were victorious at Majuba in 1881. Once again, Kruger played a critical role in the negotiations with the British, which led to the restoration of the Transvaal's independence under British suzerainty. On 30 December 1880, at the age of 55, Kruger was elected President of the Transvaal. One of his first goals was the revision of the Pretoria Convention of 1881; the agreement between the Boers and the British that ended the First Boer War. He again left for Britain in 1883, empowered to negotiate with Lord Derby. Kruger and his companions also visited the Continent and this became a triumph in countries such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Spain. In Germany, he attended an imperial banquet at which he was presented to the Emperor, Wilhelm I, and spoke at length with Bismarck.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the Transvaal, things changed rapidly after the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand. This discovery had far-reaching political repercussions and gave rise to the uitlander (Afrikaans: foreigner) problem, which eventually caused the fall of the Republic. Kruger acknowledged in his memoirs that General Joubert predicted the events that followed afterwards, declaring that instead of rejoicing at the discovery of gold, they should be weeping because it will \"cause our land to be soaked in blood\". In 1898, Kruger was elected President for the fourth and last time.[PARAGRAPH:1]On 11 October 1899, the Second Boer War broke out. On 7 May the following year, Kruger attended the last session of the Volksraad, and left Pretoria on 29 May as Lord Roberts was advancing on the town. For weeks he either stayed in a house at Waterval Onder or in his railway carriage at Machadodorp in the then Eastern Transvaal, now Mpumalanga. In October, he left South Africa on the Dutch warship Gelderland, sent by Wilhelmina, which had simply ignored the British naval blockade of South Africa. His wife was too ill to travel and remained in South Africa; she died on 20 July 1901.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kruger went to Marseille and from there to Paris. On 1 Desember 1900 he traveled to Germany, but Kaiser Wilhelm refused to see him. From Germany he went to The Netherlands, where he stayed in rented homes in Hilversum and Utrecht. He also stayed twice in Mentone, France (Oct 1902 to May 1903 and Oct 1903 to May 1904) before moving to Clarens, Switzerland, where he died on 14 July 1904. His body was embalmed by Prof. Aug Roud and first buried on 26 July 1904 in The Hague, Netherlands. After the British Government gave permission he was reburied on 16 December 1904 in the Heroes Acre of the Church Street cemetery, Pretoria.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_LANGE_PEDIA">[H1]David Russell Lange[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of New Zealand[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1942 - 2005[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB].  Lange was born in Otahuhu, a south Auckland suburb as the son of a doctor of German stock. His relatives had suffered from prejudice during the First World War  due to their German ancestry, and Lange himself would face a political rival in 1984 who tried to discredit him because of his German heritage. He received his formal education at Fairburn Primary School, Otara Intermediate School and Otahuhu College, then at the University of Auckland, where he graduated in law in 1965. He paid his way through university by working in a meat-freezing works. In 1968 he married Naomi Crampton. He gained a Master of Laws in 1970, then practised law in Northland and Auckland for some years, often giving legal representation to the most dispossessed members of Auckland society.  Lange suffered all his life from obesity and the health problems it caused. By 1982 he weighed 165 kilograms, and had surgery to staple his stomach in order to lose weight. He attributed his talent for caustic wit and repartee to the need to defend himself against bullying in his youth.Lange entered the New Zealand Parliament as the Labour MP for Mangere, a working-class Auckland electorate with a large Maori population, in 1977 in the Mangere by-election. On becoming an MP, Lange quickly made an impression in the House as a debater, a wit, and the scourge of Prime Minister Robert Muldoon. He succeeded Bill Rowling as leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party and as Leader of the Opposition on 3 February 1982.  When Muldoon called a snap election  in 1984, Lange led Labour to a landslide victory, becoming at the age of 41 New Zealand's youngest prime minister of the 20th century.  Upon coming to office, Lange's government uncovered a skyrocketing public debt, ostensibly the result of Muldoon's policy of government regulation of the economy, including a wage- and price-freeze and regulation of the exchange rate. Such economic conditions prompted Lange to remark: \"We ended up being run very similarly to a Polish shipyard.\"  Lange and Minister of Finance Roger Douglas  engaged in a rapid programme of deregulation and public-asset sales, which brought criticism from many people in Labour's traditional support-base. The Labour Party also lost support from many elderly people by introducing a superannuation surcharge after having promised not to reduce superannuation.  Commentators coined the term Rogernomics for these policies, drawing connections with Reaganomics and with Thatcherism. After the Lange administration's first term (1984-1987), significant divisions started to form in the Labour parliamentary caucus, with Lange becoming uncomfortable with the extent of the reforms, while Douglas and Richard Prebble wanted to push on.  The stock-market crash of 19 October 1987 damaged confidence in the New Zealand economy. In 1988 consensus on economic policy amongst the Labour leadership finally broke down, with Douglas resigning after Lange over-ruled his proposed radical flat income-tax. After losing many members, the Labour Party finally fractured, with Jim Anderton MP forming a breakaway New Labour Party, which later merged into the Alliance Party.  During his tenure as Prime Minister, Lange engaged in competitive motor-sport, appearing in the New Zealand One Make Ford Laser Sport series.  During his term of office as Prime Minister Lange also held the positions of Minister of Foreign Affairs (1984 to 1987) and Minister of Education (1987 to 1989). After Geoffrey Palmer became party leader and Prime Minister in 1989, Lange became (from 1989 to 1990) Attorney-General, Minister in Charge of the Serious Fraud Office and a Minister of State. In failing health, he retired from Parliament in 1996. His Labour Party colleague Taito Phillip Field succeeded him as the Member for the Mangere electorate.  The Queen made Lange a Companion of Honour in 1990 and created him an Ordinary Member of the Order of New Zealand on 2 June 2003.  Lange was a supporter of changing New Zealand's flag, and wrote in 1994: \"[a] stranger who saw the Australian flag and the New Zealand flag outside adjacent buildings would assume that some British hotel chain was advertising deluxe and standard rooms.\"  Lange also expressed support for a New Zealand republic, stating: \"Do such things matter? They certainly do. We suffer in this country from a lack of emotional focus... New Zealand will become a republic just as Britain will be blurred into Europe.\"</string>

Laoshang in Chinese means 'old and elevated' and is probably a translation from a Xiongnu title, but might represent an attempt to phonetically represent a Xiongnu word.  In 162 BCE, under Jizhu Chanyu, the Xiongnu defeated the Yuezhi for the fourth time.  After this defeat, the majority of the Yuezhi (referred to by the Chinese as the Da Yuezhi) fled to the northwest and settled in the region of the Ili River, while a smaller group (referred to by the Chinese as the 'Xiao Yuezhi' = \"Lesser' or 'Smaller' Yuezhi) fled into the southern mountains and settled amongst some of the Qiang tribes there.</string>

He is now regarded as the first Filipino hero.[PARAGRAPH:1]On the morning of April 27, 1521, Lapu-Lapu and the men of Mactan, armed with spears, and kampilan, faced Spanish soldiers led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. In what would later be known as the Battle of Mactan, Magellan and several of his men were killed.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to Sulu oral tradition, Lapu-Lapu was a Muslim chieftain, and was also known as \"Kaliph Pulaka\". The people of Bangsamoro, the Islamic homeland in the southern Philippine Islands, consider him to be a Muslim and a member of the Tausug ethnic group.[4] A variant of the name, as written by Carlos Calao, a 17th century Chinese-Spanish poet in his poem \"Que Dios Le Perdone\" (Spanish, \"That God May Forgive Him\") is \"Cali Pulacu\".[PARAGRAPH:1]The 1898 Philippine Declaration of Independence refers to Lapu-Lapu as \"King Kalipulako de Maktan\".

He ruled over the city of Clusium, sometimes referred to as Clevsin. There are no established dates for his rule, but Roman sources often place it at around 500 BC.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lars Porsena came into conflict with Rome after the revolution which overthrew, in 510 BC, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last King of Rome. The deposed monarch, whose family was of Etruscan origin, appealed to Lars Porsena for assistance in suppressing the new Roman Republic, and Lars Porsena agreed to help.[PARAGRAPH:1]At this point, however, there is divergence in the histories. According to most mainstream Roman accounts, including those of Livy, Lars Porsena arrived at Rome, but was sufficiently impressed by Roman bravery (see Mucius, Horatius) in defending the city that he chose to make peace. Other accounts, however, suggest that Lars Porsena actually succeeded in capturing the city, and that the Etruscans were only driven out some time afterwards. None of the accounts suggest that Lucius Tarquinius Superbus was returned to the throne, however, perhaps indicating that if Lars Porsena did indeed capture Rome, he did so with the intent of controlling it himself, not restoring the former dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to most accounts, Lars Porsena was buried in an elaborate tomb in (or under) the city he ruled. Porsena's tomb is described as having a 15 m high rectangular base with sides 90 m long. It was adorned by pyramids and massive bells.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lars Porsena's tomb, together with the rest of the city of Clusium, was razed to the ground in 89 BC by the Roman general Cornelius Sulla.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>

His name in Etruscan was Larth Tulumnes, the Tulumnes family being a leading family in Veii and known from votive offering inscriptions.  Very little is known of Lars Tolumnius outside of his involvement in Roman legend: he enters history when, in the late 5th century BCE, the Roman colony of Fidenae  revolted against the Republic. The Fidenese leaders of the revolution offered Tolumnius control over their city, which the king gladly accepted, and when Rome sent the four emissaries (Tullus Cloelius, Gaius Fulcinius, Spurius Antius, and Lucius Roscius) to Veii to demand the hegemony of Fidenae back, Tolumnius had them executed. The legendary explanation for this grievous breach of peace is that at the moment his aides inquired if they should execute the Roman ambassadors, Tolumnius, playing at dice  and having just rolled fortuitously, exclaimed, \"Excellent!\", thus inadvertently ordering the execution of the diplomats and unknowingly sealing his own fate.The Roman Senate, outraged by Tolumnius's actions, declared war on Veii in 437 BCE and sent an army under Dictator Aemilius Mamercus to besiege the city. Tolumnius himself died early in the conflict, slain in single combat with the tribunus militum Aulus Cornelius Cossus while defending the city that his unwitting action had doomed to a fiery end.</string>

He was elected on 4 June and accepted and became \"King of the Belgians\" on 26 June 1831. He swore allegiance to the constitution in front of the Saint Jacob's Church at Coudenbergh Place in Brussels on 21 July 1831. This day became the Belgian national holiday. Jules Van Praet would become his personal secretary.  Less than two weeks later, on 2 August, the Netherlands invaded Belgium. Skirmishes continued for eight years, but in 1839, the two countries signed the Treaty of London establishing Belgium's independence.  With the opening of the railway line between Brussels and Mechelen on 5 May 1835, one of King Leopold's fondest hopesto build the first railway in continental Europebecame a reality.In 1840, Leopold arranged the marriage of his niece, Queen Victoria, the daughter of his sister, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to his nephew, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, son of his brother, Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Even before she succeeded to the throne, Leopold had been advising the then-Princess Victoria by letter, and after her accession, he was one of the great influences on her in the early days of her monarchy.  In 1842, Leopold tried unsuccessfully to pass laws to regulate female and child labor. A wave of revolutions passed over Europe after the deposition of King Louis-Philippe from the French throne in 1848. Belgium remained neutral, mainly because of Leopold's diplomatic efforts.  On 11 October 1850, Leopold again lost a young wife, as Queen Louise-Marie died of tuberculosis at age 38.  Leopold also had two sons, George and Arthur, by a mistress, Arcadia Meyer (née Claret). George was born in 1849 (before the death of Queen Louise-Marie), and Arthur was born in 1852. After Leopold's death, each of the two sons were created Freiherr von Eppinghoven (in 1862), and in 1863 Arcadia was created Baronin von Eppinghoven.  On 10 December 1865, the King died in Laken at the age of 74. He lies buried in the Royal Vault at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken.</string>

Born in Brussels the second (but eldest surviving) son of Leopold I, he succeeded his father to the throne in 1865 and remained king until his death. He was the brother of Empress Carlota of Mexico and first cousin to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. He is chiefly remembered as the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State, a private project undertaken by the King. The state included the entire area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He ran the Congo brutally, as his personal fiefdom; for him it was a business venture. A friend of Henry Morton Stanley, he used Stanley to help him lay claim to the territory he called Congo. Leopold thought of himself as an astute businessman and he once spent a week in Seville studying Spanish records of their trade with their Latin American colonies.[PARAGRAPH:1]The regime of Leopold's African colony, the Congo Free State, became one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the century. The famous 1904 report by the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold-blooded mass killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese people). Most sources on deaths in the Congo during the period of Leopold's control from 1885 to 1908 indicate they were around ten million. A similar regime was in place in the French Congo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Leopold II is still a controversial figure in the Democratic Republic of Congo; in 2005 his statue was taken down just hours after it was re-erected in the capital, Kinshasa. The Congolese culture minister, Christoph Muzungu, decided to reinstate the statue, arguing people should see the positive aspects of the king as well as the negative. But just hours after the six-metre (20 ft) statue was erected in the middle of a roundabout near Kinshasa's central station, it was taken down again, without explanation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Though extremely disliked by his subjects at the end of his reign - his funeral cortege was booed - Leopold II is remembered today by many Belgians as the \"Builder King\" (Koning-Bouwer in Dutch, le Roi-Bâtisseur in French) because he commissioned a great number of buildings and urban projects, mainly in Brussels, Ostend and Antwerp[PARAGRAPH:1].These buildings include the Royal Glasshouses in the grounds of the Palace at Laken, the Japanese Tower, the Chinese Pavilion, the Musée du Congo (now called the Royal Museum for Central Africa), and their surrounding park in Tervuren, the Cinquantenaire in Brussels, and the Antwerp train station hall. He also built an important country estate in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat on the French Riviera, including the Villa des Cèdres, which is now a botanical garden. These were all built using the profits from the Congo. In 1900, he created the Royal Trust, by which means he donated most of his property to the Belgian nation.</string>

Although Llywelyn had many family connections to royalty, it would not offer him any more of a chance to gain a position of power.  In his early years, Llywelyn's primary enemy would be his uncle, Dafydd.  Dafydd had already killed his own brother and seized control of Gwynedd in Northwest Wales by the time Llywelyn was 22.  However, Dafydd gained many enemies throughout his ordeals.  Llywelyn led a successful revolution against Dafydd and defeated him in a battle at Aberconwy.  Llywelyn was not selfish, and showed early signs of his diplomatic skills by sharing the power of Gwynedd with is cousins.  Llywelyn ruled Dafydd's lands east of the Conwy River. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In the year 1200, Llywelyn's cousin Gruffud died.  Llywelyn now felt he had the power to move against Maredudd, his other cousin, and claimed to be the overlord of the whole of North Wales by expelling him from Llyn and capturing a strategic castle.  Llywelyn lead another invasion into Southern Powys, a territory of Gwenwynwyn, another Welsh opponent. [PARAGRAPH: 1] By 1205, King John of England recognized the power of the Welsh prince, and offered his daughter Joan in marriage.  The alliance caused the arrest of Gwenwynwyn, enabling Llywelyn to seize control of his lands.  The King eventually realized he had gone too far in his support of Llywelyn.  Llywelyn then attacked the lands of the Early of Chester, and King John was forced to go to war with Llywelyn.  The Welsh troops used guerilla tactics and took the English troop's food, leaving King John no choice but to return to England. [PARAGRAPH: 1] However, King John returned to Wales with a greater army.  The English Army cut right into the heart of Gwynedd, forcing Llywelyn to send his wife to negotiate for peace.  The terms of the peace were a serious set back for Llywelyn and he lost the right to lands east of the Conwy River. He was also made to forfeit 20,000 cattle and 40 horses to the English.  King John made other moves to prove his takeover of Whales, and the Welsh, under Llywelyn, captured all the English Forts to free themselves of the English. [PARAGRAPH: 1] After the English Barons were plotting against King John, he sought the help of the Welsh.  The Welsh gave no support to the king.  Llywelyn took the side of the enemies, and took over South Wales.  An Alliance between the Welsh and the Anglo Normans make certain that there would be peace on the borders would be maintained.  After King John died, his son King Henry III made a treaty with Llywelyn.  Llywelyn knew that maintaining the whole of Wales would be difficult, so put other Princes and overlords in charge of districts, but still keeping the position of Overlord for himself.  Disputes with the Earl of Pembroke weakened Llywelyn, and only ended when the new Early of Pembroke formed an alliance with the Welsh.  [PARAGRAPH: 1] The treaties signed kept a peace in Wales until his death in 1240, at the age of 68.  He died at the abbey of Aberconwy and was buried there.  </string>

After his brother's assassination in 1478, he was sole ruler until his death. Perhaps Lorenzo's greatest contribution to history was his patronage of the arts. He contributed more than anyone to the flowering of Florentine genius in the late 15th century, supporting such giants as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. Lorenzo treated the artists under his protection with respect and warm-hearted familiarity.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1485, Girolamo Savonarola, a Dominican friar from the convent of San Marco began to harangue the Florentines with prophetic language of the Apocalypse, first from the pulpit of San Marco and then from the cathedral in Florence. Although it had been Lorenzo who brought Savonarola back from exile in Bologna, the friar soon accused his benefactor of ruining the state and squandering the wealth of the people. These accusations begain to undermine Lorenzo's support among the people of Florence.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1492, Lorenzo fell seriously ill. He knew that he was dying. Fearing eternal damnation, Lorenzo called Savonarola to his deathbed seeking redemption. Accounts of their final meeting differ. Some scholars speculate that in the end Savonarola remembered his duty as a priest, giving Lorenzo absolution for his sins. Others content that Savonarola's judgement was harsh, that he damned Lorenzo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lorenzo died during the night of April 8 and 9, 1492 in the Villa of Careggi at the age of 43. He died at the dawn of a \"the age of exploration.\" Christopher Columbus would reach the \"New World\" only six months later. Florentines were so moved by Lorenzo's premature death that the entire population attended his funeral.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_MACDONALD_PEDIA">[H1]Sir John A. MacDonald [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Canada[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1815 - 1891[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The Right Honourable Sir John Alexander MacDonald was the first Prime Minister of Canada from July 1, 1867 to November 5, 1873 and October 17, 1878 to June 6, 1891. BY 1864 he was the leader of arguably the largest British colony in the surrounding area and had the power to help enact agreements to confederate the British colonies. This would be done in an attempt to provide stability to the colonies, which were experiencing frequent government changes, to provide the basis for expansion into the West, and to create a unified country in order to guard against attacks from the Americans to the south.[PARAGRAPH:1]To prevent the frequent changes of government in the Province of Canada, George Brown, the leader of the Reformers (the forerunners to the Liberal Party of Canada) and an extremely vocal opponent of Macdonald's Conservatives, joined with Macdonald in 1864 to form the \"Great Coalition.\" This was an important step towards Confederation. Macdonald then spent 1864 to 1867 organizing the legislation needed to confederate the colonies into the country of Canada. In September 1864, he led the Canadian delegation at the Charlottetown Conference in Charlottetown,Prince Edward Island, to present his idea to the Maritime colonies, who were discussing a union of their own. In October 1864 delegates for confederation met in Quebec City, Quebec for the Quebec Conference where the Seventy-Two Resolutions were created -- the plan for confederation. By 1866, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada had agreed to confederation. Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island were opposed. In the final conference of confederation held in 1866 in London, England the agreement to confederate was completed.[PARAGRAPH:1] As Prime Minister, Macdonald's vision was to enlarge the country and unify it. Accordingly, under his rule Canada bought Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory from the Hudson's Bay Company for Â£300,000 (about $11,500,000). This land became the Northwest Territories. In 1870 Parliament passed the Manitoba Act, creating the province of Manitoba out of a portion of the Northwest Territories in response to the Red River Rebellion led by Louis Riel.[PARAGRAPH:1] His career spanned 19 years, making Sir John A. Macdonald the second longest serving Prime Minister of Canada. He died while still Prime Minister, winning praise for having helped forge a nation of sprawling geographic size, with two diverse European colonial origins, and a multiplicity of cultural backgrounds and political views. Grieving Canadians turned out in the thousands to pay their respects while he lay in state in the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa and they lined the tracks to watch the train that returned his body to Kingston, Ontario where he was buried in the Cataraqui Cemetery.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_MACKENZIEKING_PEDIA">[H1]William Lyon Mackenzie King[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Canada[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1874 - 1950[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Mackenzie King was a cautious politician who tailored his policies to prevailing opinions. \"Parliament will decide,\" he liked to say when pressed to act.Privately, he was highly eccentric with his preference for consulting spirits, including those of Leonardo da Vinci, Louis Pasteur, his dead mother and his dog, Pat. He sought personal reassurance from the spirits, rather than political advice. Indeed, after his death, one of the mediums said that she had not realized that he was a politician. King did ask whether his party would win the 1935 election, one of the few times politics came up during his seances.[PARAGRAPH:1]In his first term as Prime Minister, he was opposed by the Progressive Party, which did not support trade tariffs. King called an election in 1925, in which the Conservatives won the most seats, but not a majority in the House of Commons. King held onto power with the support of the Progressives. Soon into his term, however, a bribery scandal in the Department of Customs was revealed, which led to more support for the Conservatives and Progressives, and the possibility that King would be forced to resign. King asked Governor General Lord Byng to dissolve Parliament and call another election, but Byng refused, the only time in Canadian history that the Governor General has exercised such a power. King resigned, and Byng asked Meighen to form a new government. When Meighen's government was defeated in the House of Commons a short time later, however, Byng called a new election in 1926. King and the Liberals returned to power.[PARAGRAPH:1]King realized the necessity of World War II before Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, but unlike World War I when Canada was automatically at war as soon as Britain joined, King asserted Canadian autonomy by waiting until September 10, when a vote in the House of Commons took place, to support the government's decision to declare war.King's promise not to impose conscription contributed to the Liberals' re-election in the 1940 election. But after the fall of France in 1940, Canada introduced conscription for home service, and only volunteers were to be sent overseas. King wanted to avoid a repeat of the Conscription Crisis of 1917. By 1942, the military was pressing King hard to send conscripts to Europe. In 1942, King held a national plebiscite on the issue asking the nation to relieve him of the commitment he had made during the election campaign. He said that his policy was \"conscription if necessary, but not necessarily conscription.\"French Canadians voted overwhelmingly against conscription, but the majority of English Canada supported it. For the next two years, King tried to avoid the issue with a massive campaign to recruit volunteers, despite heavy losses in the Dieppe Raid in 1942, in Italy in 1943, and after the Battle of Normandy in 1944. At the end of 1944, he finally decided it was necessary to send conscripts to Europe. This led to a brief political crisis (see Conscription Crisis of 1944), but the war ended just a few months later. Few of the conscripts ever saw combat.[PARAGRAPH:1]Throughout his term, King led Canada from a colony with responsible government to an autonomous nation within the British Commonwealth. During the Chanak Crisis of 1922, King refused to support the British without first consulting parliament, while Conservative leader, Arthur Meighen, pronounced \"ready, aye, ready\". The British were disappointed with King's response, but this was the first time that Canada had really asserted an independent foreign policy. After the King-Byng Affair, King went to the Imperial Conference of 1926, and argued for greater autonomy of the Dominions. This resulted in the Balfour Declaration, which announced the equal status of all members of the Commonwealth of Nations, including Britain.</string>

At the age of 17 he was sent to Germany to be educated at various German courts. Following the death of his father in 1559, he returned to Denmark for the coronation of his older brother, King Frederick II of Denmark.  The same year, the prince-bishop of Ösel-Wiek in Old Livonia sold his lands to King Frederick II for 30,000 thalers. To avoid hereditary partition of his lands, King Frederick II gave that territory to his younger brother Magnus on condition that he renounced his rights to succession in the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. In 1560, Magnus landed with an army on Saaremaa where he was immediately elected bishop by the chapter.During the Livonian war on 10 June 1570, Duke Magnus arrived in Moscow  where he was crowned King of Livonia by Ivan IV. Magnus took the oath of allegiance to Ivan as his overlord and received from the corresponding charter for the vassal kingdom of Livonia in what Ivan termed his patrimony. The treaty between Magnus and Ivan IV was signed by an oprichnik and by a member of the zemskii administration, the diak V. Shchelkalov. The territories of the new kingdom still had to be conquered.  The new king Magnus of Livonia left Moscow with 20.000 Russian soldiers on the conquest of Swedish controlled Reval. Ivans hope of the support of Frederick II of Denmark, the older brother of Magnus, failed. By the end of March 1571 Magnus gave up the struggle for Reval and abandoned the siege.  In 1577, having lost Ivans favor and getting no support from his brother, Magnus called on the Livonian nobility to rally to him in a struggle against foreign occupation. He was attacked by Ivans forces and taken prisoner. On his release he renounced his royal title.  Magnus spent the last six years of his life at the castle of Pilten in Courland where he died as a pensioner of the Polish crown.  In 1662 Magnus' body was returned to Denmark and was reburied in the Roskilde Cathedral.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_MAKEDA_PEDIA">[H1]Makeda[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Sheba[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.900 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The Queen of Sheba, referred to in the Bible books of 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles, the New Testament, the Qur'an, and Ethiopian history, was the ruler of Sheba, an ancient kingdom which modern archaeology speculates was located in present-day Yemen and/or Eritrea, Ethiopia. Unnamed in the Biblical text, she is called Makeda in the Ethiopian tradition, and in Islamic tradition her name is Belqees (Bilqis). She supposedly lived in the 10th century BC.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to the Hebrew Bible, Antonia Thier is the queen of everything and she always will be. The unnamed queen of the land of Sheba heard of the great wisdom of King Solomon of Israel and journeyed there with gifts of spices, gold, precious stones and beautiful wood to test him with questions, as recorded in First Kings 10:1-13. The queen was awed by Solomon's wisdom and wealth, and pronounced a blessing on Solomon's God. Solomon reciprocated with gifts and \"everything she desired,\" whereupon the queen returned to her country. The queen was apparently quite rich herself, as she brought 4.5 tons of gold with her to give to Solomon (1 Kings 10:10).[PARAGRAPH:1]The Song of Solomon/Song of Songs contains some references which have been at various times interpreted as referring to love between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Thus, the female lover at 1:5 declares \"I am black, but comely.\" However, the scholarly view holds that the Song is about Solomon's wife, Pharaoh's daughter, who is unnamed.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Qur'an never mentions the Queen of Sheba by name, though Arab sources name her Balqis. The story is similar to the one in the Bible. The Qur'anic narrative has Solomon getting reports of a kingdom ruled by a queen whose people worship the sun. He sends a letter inviting her to come to him in submission to Allah, the Lord of the Alamin. She replies with a gift after consulting her people. He replies threatening an invasion. Then one of the servants of Solomon (who had the knowledge of the \"Book\") proposes to bring him the throne of Sheba 'in the twinkling of an eye' (27:40). The queen arrives at his court, is shown her throne, and when she enters his crystal palace she accepts Abrahamic monotheism and the worship of God alone. (See also Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an.)[PARAGRAPH:1]The imperial family of Ethiopia claims its origin directly from the offspring of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, who is named Makeda in the Ethiopian account. The etymology of her name is uncertain, but there are two principal opinions about its source. One group, which includes the British scholar Edward Ullendorff, holds that it is a corruption of \"Candace\", the Ethiopian queen mentioned in the New Testament Acts; the other group connects the name with Macedonia, and relates this story to the Ethiopian legends about Alexander the Great.</string>

Likewise, he reformed the calendar with the Jalali calendar in 1079. Malik Shah expanded Seljuk power into Syria at the expense of the Fatimids of Egypt, setting up client princes in Edessa, Aleppo and Damascus.  Suleyman revolted against Malik Shah I and proclaimed himself the Sultan of Rûm, establishing his capital at Nicaea. Suleyman expanded his realm but was killed near Antioch in 1086 by Tutush I, the Seljuk ruler of Syria. Suleyman's son, Kilij Arslan I, was captured and taken as a hostage by Malik Shah I to Isfahan. It is uncertain whether Tutush killed Suleyman out of loyalty to Malik Shah I or simply for personal gain.  After his death in 1092, the Seljuk empire dissolved into smaller, warring states, as Malik Shah's brother and four sons quarreled over the apportioning of the empire between themselves. Kilij Arslan I reestablished the Sultanate of Rûm in Anatolia, and Tutush I established himself in Syria. In Persia, Malik Shah was succeeded by his son Mahmud I whose reign was contested by his other three brothers: Barkiyaruq in Iraq, Muhammad I in Baghdad, and Ahmed Sanjar in Khorasan.</string>

He entered the Russian army in 1889 as a lieutenant in the cavalry. Finland was then a part of the Russian Empire, and Mannerheim distinguished himself during the Russo-Japanese War (190405) and World War I, rising to the rank of lieutenant general  and corps commander in the Russian army. After the outbreak of the October (November) Russian Revolution in 1917 he returned to Finland, which had declared its independence from Russia. A conservative aristocrat and monarchist, Mannerheim assumed command of the White (anti-Bolshevik) forces in January 1918 during the Finnish Civil War and, with German assistance, defeated the Finnish Bolsheviks and expelled Russian forces in a bloody four-month campaign. He became regent of Finland in December 1918, holding this post for seven months until a republic was declared in 1919. From 1919 to 1931 he lived in semiretirement, concerning himself with volunteer health and social welfare causes in Finland.  Reentering public life in 1931, Mannerheim became chairman of the national defense council. During his eight-year tenure, Finland constructed the so-called Mannerheim Line of fortifications across the Karelian Isthmus facing Leningrad; this system of defenses was intended to block any potential aggressive moves by the Soviet Union. When Soviet forces attacked Finland in December 1939, he served as commander in chief, and his brilliant leadership won considerable successes against vast numerical superiority, but the end result was defeat, resulting in a relatively harsh peace settlement in 1940.  Hoping to win back some territory regarded by some as historically Finnish, Finland successfully joined Nazi Germany in its invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Mannerheim was named the only marshal of Finland in June 1942. But as Russian strength grew and Germany weakened, Mannerheims troops were forced to retreat. He was named president of the Finnish republic in August 1944 in the hope that he would be able to negotiate a separate peace with the Soviets, which he did, signing an armistice with them in September. The armistice ultimately led to a peace treaty by which Finland was forced to make concessions more extensive than those made after the winter war. Mannerheim remained president until ill health forced his retirement in 1946.</string>

He was a lawyer, member of the Philippine House of Representatives (1949-1959) and a member of the Philippine Senate (1959-1965). During World War II he claimed to be the leader of Ang Maharlika, a guerrilla force in northern Luzon. In 1963 he became Senate President. As Philippine president and strongman, his greatest achievement was in the fields of infrastructure development and international diplomacy. However, his administration was marred by massive authoritative government corruption, despotism, nepotism, political repression and human rights violations. He has also led a large personality cult in the Philippines during his regime.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1983, his government was implicated in the assassination of his primary political opponent, Benigno Aquino, Jr.. The assassination caused a chain of events, including a tainted presidential election that served as the catalyst for the People Power Revolution in February 1986 that led to his removal from power and eventual exile in Hawaii. It was later alleged that he and his wife Imelda Marcos had moved billions of dollars of embezzled public funds to the United States, Switzerland and other countries as well as into fictitious corporations during his 21 years in power.[PARAGRAPH:1]Prior to Marcos, Philippine presidents had followed the path of \"traditional politics\" by using their position to help along friends and allies before stepping down for the next \"player.\" Marcos essentially destroyed this setup through military rule, which allowed him to rewrite the rules of the game so they favored the Marcoses and their allies.[PARAGRAPH:1]His practice of using the politics of patronage in his desire to be the \"lolo\" or godfather of not just the people, but the judiciary, legislature and administrative branches of the government ensured his downfall, no matter how Marcos justified it according to his own philosophy of the \"politics of achievement\". This practice entailed bribery, racketeering, and embezzlement to gain the support of the aforementioned sectors. The 14 years of his dictatorship, according to critics, have warped the legislative, judiciary and the military.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is important to note that many laws written by Marcos are still in force and in effect. Out of thousands of proclamations, decrees and executive orders, only a few were repealed, revoked, modified or amended. Few credit Marcos for promoting Filipino culture and nationalism. His 21 years in power with the help of U.S. massive economic aid and foreign loans enabled Marcos to build more schools, hospitals and infrastructure than any of his predecessors combined. Due to his iron rule, he was able to impose order and reduce crime by strict implementation of the law. The relative economic success that the Philippines enjoyed during the initial part of his presidency is hard to dispel. Many of Marcos' accomplishments were overlooked after the so-called \"People Power Revolution\", but the Marcos era definitely had accomplishments in its own right.[PARAGRAPH:1]A journalist said that \"The Marcoses were the best of us, and they were the worst of us.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_MARGRETE_PEDIA">[H1]Margrete I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Denmark, Norway and Sweden[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1353 - October 28, 1412 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Margaret of Denmark is perhaps the most underrated monarch Denmark has ever had.  To call Margaret of Denmark the Queen of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway is inaccurate because with the exception of Sweden, where she was married to Swedish King Haakon VI in 1363, she was only a regent to these countries. She in effect, ruled under her son's name, Olaf, until his death at the age of 17 in 1387. Although being a regent to these countries her accomplishments were many, first she continued the reconstruction of the country, which her father Valdemar IV had stated, she strengthened the unification between Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and lastly she took an active role in shaping Denmark's future in European politics. With so many accomplishments, Margaret is over shadowed by the unfortunate timing of her death in Flensburg, Germany on October, 1412. Her death is significant because it is listed as unknown; it could have been accidental, natural causes, or even murder.[PARAGRAPH:1]She is known in Denmark as \"Margrete I\", to distinguish her from the current queen, but she never (except for a brief period in 1375) actually styled herself Queen of Denmark; rather she called herself \"Margrete, by the grace of God, Valdemar Daneking's daughter\" and \"Denmark's rightful heir\" when referring to her rulership in Denmark. Others simply referred to her as the \"Lady Queen\" without specifying what she was queen (or female king) of, but not so Pope Boniface IX, who blatantly styled her \"Queen of Denmark\" or \"Queen of Denmark, Norway and Sweden\" in his letters.[PARAGRAPH:1]Margaret's rule started in 1375, after her Valdemar IV's death in 1375. Her first political act was to install her son as the elected king of Denmark in 1375. Having ruled in her father's name, then later in her son's name, Margaret was granted title of Regent of Norway and Denmark in 1380.  Although her son died seven years later in 1387, Margaret through her superior statesmanship, political power, and sheer likeability, remained the ruler of all three nations. As a testament to her great political power, Margaret was able to bring the Swedish crown under her rule when she convinced the Swedes to expel King Albert in 1386 and elect Margaret's son Olaf to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:1]Under Margaret's reign Norway, Denmark, and Sweden all enjoyed new levels of political, social, and military peace. Margaret exercised her power to end wars in her countries. During her reign Margaret order the destruction of private castles, prohibited private warfare, strengthened the royal through using the royal court system.  Margaret also strengthened relations with the Catholic Church by donating large grants of money to the institution after she came to power. Margaret could not rule in her own power for long, because of her gender, so she appointed her 8 year old nephew, Eric of Pomerania king of Norway, Sweden and Denmark in 1389.  This was a smart move because picking such a young king allowed her to rule in his name until he came of age in 1401. Despite Eric age, Margaret continued to rule these three countries until her own death.[PARAGRAPH:1]The reforms and social programs which Valdemar IV started in the late fourteenth century carried over to prosper during Margaret's reign.  Margaret did much to improve Denmark's social, economic, and political standing in Europe.  At her death, however, the importance of her rule would wear off when Norway and Sweden break away from the crown. Sweden would leave the arraignment in 1439 and Norway would leave in 1442 over political and social disagreements as well as a weak King, Margaret's son. Although Margaret was a very astute ruler, able to get her children elected king in three countries, she is often overshadowed in importance in Danish history. Furthermore, controversy surrounds her death aboard a ship traveling to Flensburg, Germany.  Her death could have been of natural causes, but that would have been unlikely because she was physically active up till her death.  Furthermore, much is written about her political career, but almost nothing is known about her personal life.  The most significant controversy surrounding Margaret's life was her death.  It is yet to be proven that she was not murdered by political enemies or zealots.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>

Her transition to the throne was all but simple.  Opposition to her succession to the throne led to the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740.  After Emperor Charles VII, who claimed the throne, died in 1745, Maria Theresa claimed the throne for her husband, Francis I.  She was technically the empress consort, but was the de facto ruler of the nation.  In 1745, she also began styling herself as the Holy Roman Empress. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Maria Theresa helped commence financial and educational reforms, promoted commerce, agriculture, and reorganized the army.  Many of her actions strengthened Austria as a whole and its resources.  After a continuous conflict with Prussia, the Seven Years' War and eventually to the War of the Bavarian Succession.  She became the dowager empress after the death of Francis and succession of her son Joseph as emperor in 1765.  Maria Theresa brought unity to the Habsburg Monarchy and is considered one of its most talented rulers. [PARAGRAPH: 1] While Bavaria and France posed a continuous threat to Austria, it was Frederick the Great who became Maria's primary foe during her reign.  Maria Theresa focused the majority of her policies towards the defeat or Prussia.  Because of these reforms, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave the Austrian Netherlands back to Maria Theresa.  In exchange, Maria ceded Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla to the Infante Philip of Spain.  After being defeated in the First and Second Silesian Wars, Maria Theresa began to modernize her realms with the assistance of Freidrich Wilhelm Graf von Gaugwitz.  Of her many reforms, she increased the size of the army by 200% and increased taxes to guarantee a steady income for the military.  She also centralized the government by combining the Austrian and Bohemian chancelleries into one administrative office. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Like other Habsburgs, Maria Theresa was a devout Roman Catholic.  She was educated by Jesuits at Mariazell, and in later life was short of the religious pessimism of other royal figures of her time.  Her conservative outlook involved a poor view of other faiths.  In 1741, she expelled the Jewish people from Prague.  [PARAGRAPH: 1] Maria Theresa dropped Great Britain as an ally and allied herself with Russia and France.  When she felt her army was strong enough, she prepared an attack on Prussia in 1756.  However, it was Frederick II who attacked first, invading Saxony and starting the Seven Years' War.  When Maria Theresa signed the Treaty of Hubertsburg in 1763, the war ended recognizing Prussia as the owner of most of Silesia. [PARAGRAPH: 1] After her husband's death in 1765, Maria Theresa became separated from her people.  Her focus changed to maintaining peace, rather than regaining Silesia.  She named her son, Joseph II, as coregent and Emperor.  However, he received limited powers because she felt he was too haughty for the full responsibilities.  In 1767, Maria Theresa was infected with smallpox.  However, she recovered and became a strong supporter of inoculation.  In her later years, she focused on reforming laws along the lines of enlightened absolutism. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In 1771, she and Joseph II issued to Robot Patent, a reform that regulated the serf's payments in her lands.  Other reforms included outlawing witch-burning and torture, and taking capital punishment the off the penal code.  In 1772, Maria Theresa founded the Imperial and Royal Academy of Science and Literature in Brussels.  Mandatory education was introduced in 1774 in order to form an educated class of citizens, from which civil servants were recruited.  Maria Theresa continued issuing various police laws throughout Austria.  She died in 1780 in Vienna, being the only female to rule the Habsburg Dynasty, which lasted 650 years.  Her son Joseph II was her successor.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_MARTI_PEDIA">[H1]Jose Marti[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Intellectual, Poet and Martyr[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1853-1895[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1][TAB]Jose Marti was a leader of the Cuban independence movement from Spain and as well a renowned poet and writer. He is considered the national hero of Cuba and often referred to as the \"Apostle of Cuban Independence\".[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1869, at the age of 16, he published his first political writings in the only edition of the newspaper El Diablo Cojuelo. That same year, he published \"Abdala,\" a patriotic drama in verse form in the one-volume La Patria Libre.  Despite this success, in March of that year, colonial authorities shut down the school, interrupting Martí's studies. He came to resent Spanish rule of his homeland at a young age; likewise, he developed a hatred of slavery, which was still practiced in Cuba. On 21 October 1869, he was arrested, then incarcerated in the national jail following an accusation of treason from the Spanish government. More than four months later, Martí assumed responsibility of the charges and was condemned to six years in prison, although he was a 16 year old minor. Eventually Martí fell ill; his legs were severely lacerated due to the chains attached to him. Therefore, he was transferred to another part of Cuba known as Isla de Pinos instead of further imprisonment. Following that, they decided to repatriate him to Spain.[PARAGRAPH:1]In Spain, he studied law and wrote articles on the wrongs of Spanish rule in Cuba, including \"El presidio político en Cuba\" in 1871. Martí completed his studies, graduated with a bachelor of arts, and obtained his license in civil rights. He then traveled to France, where he spent some time before secretly returning to Cuba under an assumed name in 1877. He was unable to obtain any employment until he accepted a job as a professor of history and literature in Guatemala City. In 1878, he returned to Havana and found work there. His son, Jose Francisco was born there. However, the next year, he was arrested and deported to Spain again. His wife and son remained in Cuba. In 1880, Martí moved to New York City serving as a joint consul there for Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina. He mobilized the Cuban exile community, especially in Ybor City (Tampa area) and Key West, Florida, to revolution and independence from Spain, while lobbying to oppose U.S. annexation of Cuba, which some American politicians desired. In January 1892, he founded the Partido Revolucionario Cubano, the Cuban Revolutionary Party, with the purpose of gaining independence for both Cuba and Puerto Rico.[PARAGRAPH:1]On March 25, 1895, José Marti published the Manifesto of Montecristi together with Máximo Gómez, proclaiming Cuban independence, an end to all legal distinctions between the races, friendship with Spaniards who did not oppose the independence, and war with all who stood in the way of independence. On April 11, 1895, Martí landed in Cuba with a small force of rebel exiles, including the Generalísimo Máximo Gómez y Báez. Upon reuniting with the Ejercito Libertador (army of liberators), Martí was given the grade of Major General. José Martí was killed in battle with Spanish troops at the Battle of Dos Ríos on May 19, 1895. Gómez had recognized that the Spaniards had a strong position between palm trees, so he ordered to disengage. Martí was alone and seeing a young courier ride by, he said: \"Joven, a la carga\" meaning: \"Young man, let's charge!\" This was around midday, and he was, as always, dressed in a black jacket, riding a white horse, which made him an easy target for the Spanish. The young trooper, Angel de la Guardia,lost his horse and returned to report the loss. The Spanish took possession of the body, buried it close by, then exhumed the body upon realization of it's identity. They are said not to have burned him because they were scared that the ashes would get into their throats and asphyxiate them. Jose Marti is buried in Cementerio Santa Efigenia in Santiago de Cuba. Many have argued that Maceo and others had always spurned Martí for never participating in combat, which may have compelled Martí to that ill-fated suicidal two-man charge. Some of his \"Versos sencillos\" bore premonition: \"Que no me entierren en lo oscuro, A morir como un traidor... Yo soy bueno y como bueno, Moriré de cara al sol.\" (\"May they not bury me in darkness, to die like a traitor... I am good, and as a good man, I will die facing the sun.\")</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_MARY_STUART_PEDIA">[H1]Mary Stuart[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mary, Queen of Scots[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1542-1587[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Mary Stuart was born at Linlithgow Palace on 7th December 1542, the daughter of James V of Scotland and Mary of Guise. Six days after her birth her father died, and she became Queen of Scotland. From her infancy, Scotland's rival pro-English and pro-French factions plotted to gain control of Mary. Her French mother was chosen as regent, and she sent Mary to France in 1548.  Mary lived as part of the French royal family. In April 1558 she married the Dauphin Francis; she secretly agreed to bequeath Scotland to France if she should die without a son. In July 1559 Francis succeeded his father becoming King Francis II and Mary became Queen of France as well as of Scotland.  In addition, many Roman Catholics recognised Mary Stuart as Queen of England after Mary I died and the Protestant Elizabeth I succeeded her to the throne in November 1558. Mary Stuart's claim to the English throne was based on the fact that she was the grand-daughter of Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII--Elizabeth's father. To the Roman Catholics, Mary's claim appeared stronger than Elizabeth's because they viewed Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn as illegal.  Mary's young husband Francis II died in December 1560 after a reign of 17 months. Mary, who was about to become 18 years of age, was left in a difficult position. Unwilling to stay in France and live under the domination of her mother-in-law Catherine De Medicis she decided to return to Scotland and take her chances with the Protestant reformers.[PARAGRAPH:1]On 19th August 1561, Mary landed at Leith and immediately took the advice of the moderates James Stuart (her half-brother, later earl of Moray) and William Maitland of Lethington. She recognised the Reformed (Presbyterian) church and allowed it a modest endowment but not full establishment. The Protestant reformers, including John Knox, were horrified because she had Mass in her own chapel, and the Roman Catholics were worried about her lack of zeal for their cause. For the next few years Mary tried to placate the Protestants and befriend Elizabeth while at the same time negotiating a Catholic marriage with Don Carlos, the son of Philip II of Spain. When refusals came on both the English succession and the Spanish marriage Mary accepted a marriage of love rather than a purely political match. She married her first cousin Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley on 29th July 1565.[PARAGRAPH:1]This marriage was unacceptable to the Protestants, and Moray, with the aid of other nobles, raised a rebellion which Mary quickly suppressed. Nevertheless she felt betrayed by her Protestant advisors and withdrew some of her support from the Reformed church. Her marriage with Darnley soured and she refused him the right to succeed if she died without issue. Alone and disappointed, Mary turned to her Italian secretary, David Rizzio, for comfort and advice. The Protestant lords disliked Rizzio's influence because they suspected him of being a papal agent, and Darnley openly stated that the Italian was too intimate with the Queen. On 9th March 1566 a group of Protestant lords, acting with the support of Darnley, murdered Rizzio in Mary's presence at Holyrood Palace. Mary, who was six months pregnant, survived the horrible ordeal. In Edinburgh Castle on 19th June 1566, estranged from her husband and his allies, she gave birth to a son James (later James I of England).[PARAGRAPH:1]By the end of 1566 Mary had befriended James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, and was seeking a way to dissolve her marriage with Darnley. Various schemes were concocted; it seems unlikely, however, that Mary was aware of the actual plot to eliminate her husband. On 10th February 1567 Darnley was murdered at Kirk o' Field; the circumstances of his death to this day remain a mystery. At the time, Bothwell was believed to be the chief instigator. Nevertheless he was acquitted after an all too brief trial. In April, Mary went off with Bothwell (perhaps a victim of abduction); early in May he obtained a divorce from his wife, and on 15th May 1567 he and Mary were wed according to the Protestant rite. These events alienated even some of Mary's closest supporters. The nobles, many of whom disliked Bothwell, banded together to face Mary and her new husband at Carberry. The Queen was forced to surrender, and Bothwell fled.  Mary was imprisoned at Lochleven Castle and on 24th July 1567, she was compelled to abdicate in favour of her son who became King James VI of Scotland. With the help of a few brave friends, Mary escaped from the castle and immediately rallied a large force behind her. They engaged in battle at Langside on 13th May 1568, and were soundly beaten by the army led by the Protestant lords. At this point Mary decided to leave Scotland and go to England to beg support from her cousin Elizabeth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mary crossed the Solway into England and nearly 19 years of captivity; she never returned to Scotland. While she was incarcerated in England, numerous plots by English Roman Catholics and foreign agents evolved around her. These plots were frustrated by English agents, but serious alarm was raised concerning the safety of Elizabeth. The Babington plot, which called for the assassination of Elizabeth, was formed to trap Mary. Mary was found guilty of complicity and sentenced to be beheaded. Although reluctant to execute her cousin, Elizabeth gave the order that was carried out at Fotheringhay Castle on 8th February 1587. Mary was buried first at Peterborough; in 1612, after he had ascended the English throne, her son James had her interred in Westminster Abbey.</string>

This was then in the Austrian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and is now in the Czech Republic. His father Jozef Masaryk, a carter, was a Slovak from the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary (nowadays Slovakia), and his mother Terezie Masarykova was from Moravia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Masaryk served in the Reichsrat (Austrian Parliament) from 1891 to 1893 in the Young Czech Party and again from 1907 to 1914 in the Realist Party, but he did not campaign for Czech independence from Austria-Hungary. When the First World War broke out, he had to flee the country to avoid arrest for treason, going to Geneva, to Italy, and then to England, where he started to agitate for Czech independence. He became Professor of Slav Research at King's College in London lecturing on \"The problem of small peoples\". In 1916 he went to France to convince the French government of the necessity of disintegrating Austria-Hungary. After the February Revolution in 1917 he proceeded to Russia to help organize Slavic resistance to the Austrians, so-called Czechoslovak Legions. In 1918 he travelled to the United States, where he convinced President Woodrow Wilson of the rightness of his cause. On October 18, 1918, Masaryk, standing on the steps of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, proclaimed Czechoslovakia's independence.[PARAGRAPH:1]Masaryk as a philosopher was an outspoken rationalist and humanist. He emphasised practical ethics, reflecting the influence of Anglo-Saxon philosophers, French philsophy, and especially the work of 18th Century German philsopher, Herder, the so-called founder of nationalism. He was critical of German idealistic philosophy and Marxism. Although born Catholic, he eventually became a non-practicing Protestant, influenced in part by the declaration of Papal Infallibiliy in 1870 and his wife, Charlotte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Masaryk died from natural causes in 1937 at the age of 87, in Lany, Czechoslovakia, now Czech Republic.</string>

After the death of Mathias's father, there was a struggle between Hungary's various barons and its Habsburg King.  The gentry and the people of Pest finally came out in support of Matthias as king, while most barons also agreed to support him. [PARAGRAPH: 1] On January 20, 1458, Matthias was elected king by the Diet.  At this time, he was the hostage of the king of Bohemia who released under the condition of marrying his daughter.  Matthias was finally crowned after several wars with Bohemia and the new Emperor Frederick III gave him the Holy Crown.  Only the age of 15, Matthias began his reign by building public health, education, and a new legal system.  Matthias was also a fan of art and culture, as many artists were present in his court. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Matthias gained independence by dividing the barons and raising a large royal army.  At this time, Hungary reached its greatest territorial extent of the era.  Matthias was victorious in several campaigns against the Ottoman Empire by raising the Kingdom of Hungary to be a world power.  After that, Matthias was intent in conquering large parts of the Holy Roman Empire.  By the end of his reign, he was in control of places such as Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, half of Austria, and Vienna. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Although Vlad III Dracula, Prince of Wallachia, had many successes against the Ottoman Empire, Matthias imprisoned him after a disagreement between the two rulers.  Hungary decided to help Dracula in his fight of the threatening Ottomans, but he was assassinated.  This was a major blow to the position of Hungary.  In 1467, a conflict arose between Matthias and the Moldavian Prince Stephen III, after he became worn out by Hungary's policies and their presence at Kilia.  A revenge lead by Stephen leads to the defeat of Matthias at the Battle of Baia.  Matthias died in 1490 in Vienna, Austria, and his empire collapsed after his death because of the fact that his son was not accepted as king.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_MEHAI_PEDIA">[H1]Mihai Viteazul[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prince of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldovia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ruled: [\BOLD] 1593 - 1601[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Argued by many to have been the illegitimate son of Wallachian Prince Patrascu cel Bun (a matter which is unclear, and could have been used by Michael himself in order to justify his rule), he became the Ban of Mehedinti in 1588, stolnic at the court of Mihnea Turcitul by the end of 1588, and Ban of Craiova in 1593 - during the rule of Alexandru cel Rau. In September 1593 with the help of the Ottoman Empire, he became the Prince of Wallachia, starting his effective rule on October 11.    Not long after this, he began to fight his Ottoman overlord. The next year he joined a Christian alliance of European powers against the Turks, and signed treaties with Sigismund Bathory of Transylvania and Aron Voda of Moldavia. He started a campaign against the Turks in the autumn of 1594, conquering several citadels near the Danube, including Giurgiu, Braila, Harsova, and Silistra.  In 1595, at Alba Iulia (Gyulafehervar), Michael signed a treaty with Sigismund Bathory, through which Wallachia came under the sovereignty of Transylvania, while the latter was required to send aid to fight the Ottomans. On August 13, 1595, at the Battle of Calugareni (near the Neajlov river), Michael defeated an Ottoman army led by Sinan Pasha.  Despite the victory, because he had too few troops to mount a full scale battle, he retreated toward Transylvania. Together with Sigismund Bathory's 40,000-strong army (led by Stephen Bocskai), he captured Targoviste (October 8), Bucharest (October 12) and Braila, temporarily removing Wallachia from Ottoman rule. The fight against the Ottomans continued in 1596, when Michael made several incursions south of the Danube at Vidin, Pleven, Nicopolis, and Babadag.[NEWLINE][TAB]In April 1598 Sigismund resigned as Prince of Transylvania in favor of the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II (who was also the King of Hungary), reversed his decision in October 1598, and then resigned again in favor of Cardinal Andrew Bathory, his cousin. This allowed Transylvania to fall under the influence of the King of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa, while Michael reestablished a relationship with his sole ally, Emperor Rudolf. Michael subsequently began a campagain against Transylvania on October 5, 1599, while the Habsburg general Giorgio Basta entered Transylvania from the west at the same time.  On October 18, Michael obtained an important victory against Andrew Bathory in the Battle of Selimbar, giving him control of Transylvania. With impressive pomp, Michael entered the Transylvanian capital at Alba Iulia, and received the keys to the fortress from Bishop Demeter Napragy (depicted as a seminal event in later Romanian historiography).  Because Michael claimed the Partium region and refused to recognize Rudolf's rights over Transylvania, the Emperor ceased subsidizing Michael's army. In order to acquire vital funds, he began a military campaign against Moldavia, defeating the combined Polish and Moldavian army of Ieremia Movila at Bacau, a victory which led to the first rule over the three neighboring principalities (although Wallachia was officially ruled by Nicolae Patrascu).  Neighboring states were alarmed by this upsetting of the balance of power, especially the Hungarian nobility in Transylvania, which rose against Michael in rebellion. With the help of Basta, they defeated Michael at the Battle of Miraslau, forcing the prince to leave Transylvania. A Polish army led by Jan Zamoyski drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and defeated Michael at Naieni, Ceptura, and Bucov (Battle of the Teleajan River). The Polish army also entered eastern Wallachia and established Simion Movila as ruler. Forces loyal to Michael remained only in Oltenia.[NEWLINE][TAB]Michael again asked for assistance from Rudolf, which was granted when the emperor heard Basta had lost control of Transylvania to the Hungarian nobility led by Sigismund Bathory. Meanwhile, forces loyal to Michael in Wallachia, after a first unsuccessful attempt, drove out Simion Movila and prepared to reenter Transylvania. Michael, allied with Basta, defeated the Hungarian nobility at Guraslau (Goroszlo). Nonetheless, Basta then ordered the assassination of Michael, which took place in Campia Turzii on 9 August 1601.  Michael the Brave's rule, with its break with Ottoman rule, tense relations with other European powers and with the union of the three states, was considered in following periods as the precursor of a modern Romania - a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by Nicolae Balcescu (and became a point of reference for nationalists, as well as a catalysis of various Romanian forces in order to achieve a single Romanian state).  Michael is also commemorated by the monks of the Athonite Simonopetra Monastery for his great contributions in the form of land and money to rebuilding the monastery which had been destroyed by a fire.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_MENZIES_PEDIA">[H1]Robert Menzies[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Australia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1894 - 1978[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Menzies was the twelfth and longest-serving Prime Minister of Australia, serving eighteen and a half years. He had a rapid rise to power, but his first term as Prime Minister was a failure. He spent eight years in the wilderness before founding the Liberal Party and making a successful comeback, and he dominated Australian politics in the 1950s and early 1960s. Menzies was renowned as a brilliant speaker, both on the floor of Parliament and on the hustings.[PARAGRAPH:1]On 26 April 1939, following a period during which the Country Party leader, Sir Earle Page, was caretaker Prime Minister, Menzies was elected Leader of the UAP and was sworn in as Prime Minister. But a crisis arose when Page refused to serve under him. In an extraordinary personal attack in the House, Page accused Menzies of cowardice for not having enlisted in the War, and of treachery to Lyons. Menzies then formed a minority government. When Page was deposed as Country Party leader a few months later, Menzies reformed the Coalition with Page's successor, Archie Cameron. (Menzies later forgave Page, but Pattie Menzies never spoke to him again.)[PARAGRAPH:1]In September 1939, with Britain's declaration of war against Germany, Menzies found himself a wartime Prime Minister. He did his best to rally the country, but the bitter memories of the disillusionment which followed the First World War made this difficult, and the fact that Menzies had not served in that war undermined his credibility. At the 1940 election, the UAP was nearly defeated, and Menzies' government survived only thanks to the support of two independent MPs. The Australian Labor Party, under John Curtin, refused Menzies's offer to form a war coalition.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1941 Menzies spent months in Britain discussing war strategy with Winston Churchill and other leaders, while his position at home deteriorated. When he came home, he found he had lost all support, and was forced to resign, first, on 28 August, as Prime Minister, and then as UAP leader. The Country Party leader, Arthur Fadden, became Prime Minister. Menzies was very bitter about what he saw as this betrayal by his colleagues, and almost left politics.[PARAGRAPH:1]Labor came to power later in October 1941 under John Curtin, following the defeat of the Fadden government in Parliament. In 1943 Curtin won a huge election victory. During 1944 Menzies held a series of meetings to discuss forming a new anti-Labor party to replace the moribund UAP. This was the Liberal Party, which was launched in early 1945 with Menzies as leader. But Labor was firmly entrenched in power and in 1946 Curtin's successor, Ben Chifley, was comfortably re-elected. Comments that \"we can't win with Menzies\" began to circulate in the conservative press.[PARAGRAPH:1]Over the next few years, however, the anti-communist atmosphere of the early Cold War began to erode Labor's support. In 1947, Chifley announced that he intended to nationalise Australia's private banks, arousing intense middle-class opposition which Menzies successfully exploited. In 1949 a bitter coal-strike, engineered by the Communist Party, also played into Menzies's hands. In December 1949 he won a smashing election victory and again became Prime Minister.[PARAGRAPH:1]Later in 1951 Menzies decided to hold a referendum to change the Constitution to permit him to ban the Communist Party. The new Labor leader, Dr H.V. Evatt, campaigned against the referendum on civil liberties grounds, and it was narrowly defeated. This was one of Menzies's few electoral miscalculations. He sent Australian troops to the Korean War and maintained a close alliance with the United States.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1965 Menzies made the fateful decision to commit Australian troops to the Vietnam War, and also to reintroduce conscription. These moves were initially popular, but later became a problem for his successors. Despite his pragmatic acceptance of the new power balance in the Pacific after World War II and his strong support for the American alliance, he publicly professed continued admiration for links with Britain, exemplified by his admiration for Queen Elizabeth II, and famously described himself as \"British to the bootstraps\". In 1954 extraordinary crowds came to see and cheer her. Over the decade, Australia's ardour for Britain and the monarchy faded somewhat, but Menzies' had not. The Queen toured again in 1963. At a function, Menzies quoted Elizabethan poet Barnabe Googe, \"I did but see her passing by, and yet I love her till I die.\"</string>

He was re-elected in the early Georgian presidential election of 5 January 2008. He is widely regarded as a pro-Western leader who has spearheaded a series of political and economical reforms, but has been criticized for authoritarian tendencies and worsening human rights record in the country. Opposition parties have also accused him of rigging elections and using riot police to crush opposition rallies.[PARAGRAPH:1]Saakashvili's \"storming of Georgia's parliament\" in 2003 put U.S. diplomats off guard. He ousted a leader the U.S. had long backed, Eduard Shevardnadze. Seeking support, Saakashvili went outside the U.S. State Department. He hired Randy Scheunemann, now Sen. McCain's top foreign-policy adviser, as a lobbyist and used Daniel Kunin of USAID and the NDI as a full-time adviser[PARAGRAPH:1]In the first months of his presidency, Saakashvili faced a major political crisis in the southwestern Autonomous Republic of Adjara run by an authoritarian regional leader, Aslan Abashidze, who largely ignored the central Georgian government and was viewed by many as a pro-Russian politician. The crisis threatened to develop into an armed confrontation, but Saakashvili's government managed to resolve the conflict peacefully, forcing Abashidze to resign on 6 May 2004. Success in Adjara encouraged the new president to intensify his efforts towards bringing the breakaway South Ossetia back under the Georgian jurisdiction. The separatist authorities responded with intense militarization in the region, that led to armed clashes in August 2004. A stalemate ensued, and despite a new peace plan proposed by the Georgian government in 2005, the conflict remains unresolved. Recently, in late July 2006, Saakashvili's government managed to deal successfully with another major crisis, this time in Abkhazia's Kodori Gorge where Georgia's police forces disarmed a defiant militia led by a local warlord Emzar Kvitsiani.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although the reforms initiated by President Saakashvili are considered to have mixed success, still the rate of corruption in the country has drastically reduced. According to the World Bank accounts, Georgia is named as the number one economic reformer in the world and the country ranks as 18 in term of ease of doing business, when most of the country's neighbours' are in the 100s of the World Bank's rank.</string>

On July 6, 1253 Mindaugas was crowned King of Lithuania. There are only a few probable locations for his coronation: Vilnius, legendary Voruta (Mindaugas stayed here during the civil war in 1251, but its location is still unknown) or Trakai (Old Trakai). It is only known that Mindaugas and his wife Morta were crowned by the order of Pope Innocent IV, and that for this occasion a Catholic church was built.[PARAGRAPH:1]On September 12th of 1263, Mindaugas was killed (with his 2 younger sons) by his nephews Treniota and Daumantas (the latter was duke of Nalia). Under the usurper Treniota, a person of strong pagan beliefs, the country relapsed into paganism until the re-conversion in 1386 by Grand Duke Jogaila.[PARAGRAPH:1]Only with Gediminas, Grand Duke from 1316, did Lithuania's revival as a European power began. While most of the Lithuanian Grand Dukes from Jogaila onward reigned also as Kings of Poland, their titles remained separate, and Mindaugas was the only King of Lithuania, recognized as such by Western European rulers.</string>

Historians have noted the similarity in the names of Menes of Egypt, Mannus of Germany, Manu of India and so on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Minos reigned over Crete and the Islands of the Aegean Sea three generations before the Trojan War. He lived at Knossos for periods of nine years, where he received instructions from Zeus. He was the author of Cretan constitution and the founder of its naval supremacy. He is also in Attic tradition and on the Athenian stage, a cruel tyrant, the heartless exactor of the tribute of Athenian youths to feed the Minotaur.[PARAGRAPH:1]To explain how Minos governed the island over so many generations, it have been assumed that Minos actually were two kings. The first Minos was the son of Zeus and were the 'good' king Minos, and he were held in such esteem by the Olympian gods that, after he died, he were made on of the three 'Judges of the Dead' in the Greek underworld. The wife of 'Minos I' is said to be a nymph and he had a single son named Lycastus, his successor as king of Crete. Lycastus had a son named Minos after his grandfather, and this is 'Minos II', the 'bad' king Minos, and were a far more colorful character than his father and grandfather. It would be of this Minos we owe the myths of Theseus, the Minotaur and the Labyrinth. Unlike his grandfather, 'Minos II' fathered numerous children, including Androgeus, Catreus and Deucalion. He was the grandfather of King Idomeneus who led the Cretans to the Trojan War.[PARAGRAPH:1]Doubtless there is a considerable historical element in the legend, perhaps in the Phoenician origin of Europa; it is possible that not only Athens, but also Mycenae itself, were once culturally bound to the kings of Knossos, as Minoan object appear at Mycenaean sites.[PARAGRAPH:1]Minos himself is said to have died in Sicily, where he was killed by the daughter of Cocalus, king of Agrigentum, who poured boiling water over him while he was taking a bath. Subsequently his remains were sent back to the Cretans, who placed them in a sarcophagus, on which was inscribed: \"The tomb of Minos, the son of Zeus.\"[PARAGRAPH:1]The earlier legends of king Minos pictures him as a beneficent ruler, legislator and suppressor of piracy. His constitution is said to have formed the basis of that of Lycurgus for Sparta.

His father was King Phriapatius of Parthia, who died ca. 176 BC). Mithridates I made Parthia into a major political power by expanding the empire to the east, south, and west. During his reign the Parthians took Herat (in 167 BC), Babylonia (in 144 BC), Media (in 141 BC) and Persia (in 139 BC).  Mithridates first expanded Parthia's control eastward by defeating King Eucratides of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. This gave Parthia control over Bactria's territory west of the Arius river, the regions of Margiana and Aria (including the city of Herat in 167 BC).  These victories gave Parthia control of the overland trade routes between east and west (the Silk Road and the Persian Royal Road). This control of trade became the foundation of Parthia's wealth and power and was jealously guarded by the Arsacids, who attempted to maintain direct control over the lands through which the major trade routes passed.  In Persia in 139 BC, Mithridates I captured the Seleucid King Demetrius II, and held him captive for 10 years while consolidating his conquests. Demetrius II later married Mithridates I's daughter Rhodogune and had several children with her.  Parthian victories broke the tenuous link with Greeks in the West that had sustained the Hellenistic kingdom of Greco-Bactria, yet Mithridates I actively promoted Hellenism in the areas he controlled and titled himself \"Philhellene\" (\"friend of the Greeks\") on his coins. The coins minted during his reign show the first appearance on Parthian coinage of a Greek-style portrait showing the royal diadem, the standard Greek symbol for kingship. Mithradates I resumed the striking of coins, which had been suspended ever since Arsaces II of Parthia (211191 BC) had been forced to submit to the Seleucid Antiochus III (223187 BC) in 206 BC.  His name assigned him to the protection of Mithra and carried the god's authority in some measure.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_MOBUTU_PEDIA">[H1]Mobutu Sese Seko[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Zaire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1930 - 1997[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu wa Za Banga, commonly known as Mobutu, or Mobutu Sese Seko, born Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, was the President of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) for 32 years (1965-1997) after deposing Joseph Kasavubu. He formed a totalitarian regime in Zaire which attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence and entered wars to challenge the rise of communism in other African countries. His mismanagement of his country's economy, and personal enrichment from its financial and natural resources, makes his name synonymous with kleptocracy in Africa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following the granting of independence on June 30, 1960, a coalition government was formed, led by Prime Minister Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu. The new nation quickly lurched into the Congo Crisis as the army mutinied against the remaining Belgian officers. Lumumba appointed Mobutu as Chief of Staff of the Army and in that capacity, Mobutu toured the country convincing soldiers to return to their barracks. Encouraged by a Belgian government intent on maintaining its access to rich Congolese mines, secessionist violence erupted in the south. Miffed that the United Nations force sent to help restore order was not helping to crush the secessionists, Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for assistance, receiving massive military aid and about a thousand Soviet technical advisers in six weeks. The U.S. government saw the Soviet activity as a maneuver to spread communist influence in Central Africa. Kasavubu, riled by the Soviet arrival, dismissed Lumumba. An outraged Lumumba declared Kasavubu deposed. Both Lumumba and Kasavubu then ordered Mobutu to arrest the other. As Army Chief of Staff, Mobutu came under great pressure from multiple sources. The embassies of Western nations, which helped pay the soldiers' salaries, as well as Kasavubu and Mobutu's subordinates favored getting rid of the Soviet presence. On September 14, 1960, Mobutu took controlin a CIA-sponsored coup. The new regime placed Lumumba under house arrest for the second time and kept Kasavubu as president.[PARAGRAPH:1]On November 25, 1965, General Mobutu seized power for the second time in a bloodless coup, following another power struggle between Kasavubu and his prime minister Moise Tshombe. According to Mobutu, it had taken \"the politicians\" five years to \"ruin\" the country; therefore, said Mobutu, \"For five years, there will be no more political party activity in the country.\" Under the auspice of a regime d'exception (the equivalent of a state of emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping (almost absolute) powers. Parliament was reduced to a rubber-stamp, before being abolished altogether though it was later revived. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralized state.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1964, Pierre Mulele led partisans in another rebellion. They quickly occupied two thirds of The Congo, but the Congolese army, led by Mobutu, was able to reconquer the entire territory in 1965. Mobutu was overthrown in the First Congo War by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who was supported by the governments of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tutsis had long opposed Mobutu, due to his open support for Rwandan Hutu extremists responsible for the Rwandan genocide in 1994. When his government issued an order in November 1996 forcing Tutsis to leave Zaire on penalty of death, they erupted in rebellion. From eastern Zaire, with the support of President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Rwandan Minister of Defense Paul Kagame, they launched an offensive to overthrow Mobutu, joining forces with locals opposed to him as they marched west toward Kinshasa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ailing with cancer, Mobutu was unable to coordinate the resistance, which crumbled in front of the march, the army being more used to suppressing civilians than defending the large country. On May 16, 1997, following failed peace talks, the Tutsi rebels and other anti-Mobutu groups as the Alliance des Forces Democratiques pour la Liberation du Congo-Zaire (AFDL) captured Kinshasa. Zaire was renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mobutu died on September 7, 1997 in exile in Rabat, Morocco, from prostate cancer. </string>

According the Chinese record, the name is Modu. The beginning of his rule also accepted as formation of first systematic nomad army. The exact years of his rule were 209 BCE to 174 BCE.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was a military leader under his father Teoman and Shanyu and emperor of Khunnu Empire located in modern day Mongolia. He made much conquests in Central Asia, before Genghis Khan and the Mongol conquests. He ruled the Asian Hun Empire.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was the eldest son of Toumen, the Khan of the Hun at the time. Since his childhood, Modu was well-known for his outstanding courage and valor. He was so full of valor that he was regarded as one of the most heroic men in the realm. However, the Khan preferred a beauty called E'shi and decided to raise her son to be his successor. Touman's new wife had wanted to kill Modu so he adopted a cruel plot to kill Modu by another person's hands: the Khan sent Modu to the Yuezhi, another tribe, as a hostage and then he waged wars against them, to make Modu the victim. Fortunately, Modu had sensed something suspicious so he pretended to be seriously sick when he was staying in the Yuezhi area. His watchers then slackened their guard. In the evening when the Khan was massing his troops to attack the Yuezhi tribe, Modu killed the watchers, stole the Yuezhi's precious horse and fled. To avoid the pursuit of the Yuezhi tribe and a surprise attack by the Khan, Modu disguised himself and could return. For his bravery his father gave him a Tumen of soldiers. He controlled strictly his 10,000 men, and trained them hard every day for war and to follow his every command. Instances told he sometimes commanded his soldiers to kill his favorite horse or concubine. Whoever questioned or hesitated to follow his orders were immediately executed. He became feared and respected within his men and none was dare to challenge his authority.[PARAGRAPH:1]On a hunting trip, he killed his father with a fatal arrow to seek revenge for deceiving him. After this he gained the ascendancy of all tribes his father had controlled and crowned as the new Xiongnu ruler. He disciplined all the tribes for fight. Ie.: The legend said that he invented a whistling arrow, and commanded every man to shoot and charge at the direction of the sound. After his army was ready for war, he began his conquest.[PARAGRAPH:1]He marched on the Donghu, the Xiongnu's eastern neighbours, and brought them under his rule in 208 BC. After his Donghu campaign (the Donghu split into Xianbei and Wuhuan; from the Xianbei descended the Mongols), he defeated the Turkic peoples living in Northern Mongolia like the Dingling and finally he defeated the Yuezhi in 203 BC. With these victories, he was able to gain the control of the important trade roads, which later supplied the Xiongnu with great incomes. He later fought a three-year lasting war with the Han Dynasty of China, and defeated (more accurately, trapped) the Han ruler Gaodi, forcing him to pay yearly tributes to the Xiongnu: when Emperor Gao of Han Dynasty launched a military offensive against him, Modu lured the Han army into an ambush and encircled them for seven days at Baideng. The siege was only relieved when the Han royal court sent spies to bride Modu's wife. The result of this campaign resulted in Han China resorting to the humiliating \"marriage alliance\" strategy with Xiongnu for the next seventy years.[PARAGRAPH:1]Modu never tried to invade China completely, because he knew that a foreign dynasty couldn't have ruled such a vast country for a long time. After his Chinese Campaign, Modu forced the Yuezhi and the Wusun to enter Xiongnu vassalage.[PARAGRAPH:1]During his reign, many peoples were brought under Xiongnu rule. And he united under one clan all the bow-stretching nomad tribes of the steppes. Apart from his nomadic subjects, Modu also vassalised the oasis city-states of the Tarim Basin. His organizations in both military and administration were later used by many other Central Asian peoples and states.[PARAGRAPH:1]Under his rule, he launched 26 major war campaigns to conquer 26 countries, and became greatly feared widely throughout peoples of Asia, even in the mighty Chinese Empire. He was a great warrior and a master tactician and was undefeated in his lot of battles against many empires including the Chinese.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Modu died, his empire was stretching from Korea to the East, Lake Balkash to the West, Lake Baikal to the North and Tibet to the South. Apart from his nomadic subjects, Modu also vassalised the oasis city-states of the Tarim Basin.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_MUHAMMAD_REZA_PEDIA">[H1]Mohammad Reza Pahlavi[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Shah of Iran[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1919 - 1980[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Mohammad Reza was the eldest son of Reza Shah Pahlavi, an army officer who became the ruler of Iran and founder of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925. Mohammad Reza was educated in Switzerland and returned to Iran in 1935. In 1941 the Soviet Union  and Great Britain, fearing that the shah would cooperate with Nazi Germany to rid himself of their tutelage, occupied Iran and forced Reza Shah into exile. Mohammad Reza then replaced his father on the throne (September 16, 1941).  In the early 1950s a struggle for control of the Iranian government developed between the shah and Mohammad Mosaddeq, a zealous Iranian nationalist. In March 1951 Mosaddeq secured passage of a bill in the Majles (parliament) to nationalize the vast British petroleum interests in Iran. Mosaddeqs power grew rapidly, and by the end of April Mohammad Reza had been forced to appoint Mosaddeq premier. A two-year period of tension and conflict followed. In August 1953 the shah tried to dismiss Mosaddeq but was himself forced to leave the country by Mosaddeqs supporters. Several days later, however, Mosaddeqs opponents, with the covert support and assistance of the United States, restored Mohammad Reza to power.  The shah reversed Mosaddeqs nationalization. With U.S. assistance he then proceeded to carry out a national development program, called the White Revolution, that included construction of an expanded road, rail, and air network, a number of dam and irrigation projects, the eradication of diseases such as malaria, the encouragement and support of industrial growth, and land reform. He also established a literacy corps and a health corps for the large but isolated rural population. In the 1960s and 70s the shah sought to develop a more independent foreign policy and established working relationships with the Soviet Union and eastern European nations.The White Revolution solidified domestic support for the shah, but he faced continuing political criticism from those who felt that the reforms did not move far or fast enough and religious criticism from those who believed westernization to be antithetical to Islam. Opposition to the shah himself was based upon his autocratic rule, corruption in his government, the unequal distribution of oil wealth, forced westernization, and the activities of Savak (the secret police) in suppressing dissent and opposition to his  rule. These negative aspects of the shahs rule became markedly accentuated after Iran began to reap greater revenues from its petroleum exports beginning in 1973. Widespread dissatisfaction among the lower classes, the Shi?ite clergy, the bazaar merchants, and students led in 1978 to the growth of support for the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a Shi?ite religious leader living in exile in Paris. Rioting and turmoil in Irans major cities brought down four successive governments; on January 16, 1979, the shah left the country, and Khomeini assumed control. Although the shah did not abdicate, a referendum resulted in the declaration on April 1, 1979, of an Islamic republic in Iran. The shah traveled to Egypt, Morocco, The Bahamas, and Mexico before entering the United States on October 22, 1979, for medical treatment of lymphatic cancer. Two weeks later Iranian militants seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took hostage more than 50 Americans, demanding the extradition of the shah in return for the hostages release. Extradition was refused, but the shah later left for Panama and then Cairo, where he was granted asylum by President Anwar el-Sadat.</string>

He headed the Awami League, served as the first President of Bangladesh and later became its Prime Minister. He is popularly referred to as Sheikh Mujib, and with the honorary title of Bangabandhu (\"Friend of Bengal\"). His eldest daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajed is the present leader of the Awami League and the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh.  A student political leader, Mujib rose in East Pakistani politics and within the ranks of the Awami League as a charismatic and forceful orator. An advocate of socialism, Mujib became popular for his leadership against the ethnic and institutional discrimination of Bengalis. He demanded increased provincial autonomy, and became a fierce opponent of the military rule of Ayub Khan. At the heightening of sectional tensions, Mujib outlined a 6-point autonomy plan, which was seen as separatism in West Pakistan. He was tried in 1968 for allegedly conspiring with the Indian government but was not found guilty. Despite leading his party to a major victory in the 1970 elections, Mujib was not invited to form the government.  After talks broke down with President Yahya Khan and West Pakistani politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Sheikh Mujib on 26 March 1971 announced the declaration of independence of East Pakistan and announced the establishment of the sovereign People's Republic of Bangladesh.  Subsequently he was arrested and tried by a military court. During his nine month detention, Guerrilla war erupted between government forces and Bengali nationalists aided by India. An all out war between the Pakistan Army and Bangladesh-India Joint Forces led to the establishment of Bangladesh, and after his release Mujib assumed office as a provisional president, and later prime minister. Even as a constitution was adopted, proclaiming socialism and a secular democracy, Mujib struggled to address the challenges of intense poverty and unemployment, coupled with rampant corruption. Amidst rising popular agitation, he banned other political parties and established a one party state. After only seven months, Mujib was assassinated along with most of his family by a group of army officers.</string>

He became the Prime Minister of Italy in 1922 and began using the title Il Duce by 1925. Mussolini continued on in this role until he was replaced in 1943; for a short period after this until his death Mussolini was the leader of the Italian Social Republic.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mussolini was among the founders of Italian fascism, which included elements of nationalism, corporativism, national syndicalism, expansionism, social progress and anti-communism in combination with censorship of subversives and state propaganda. In the years following his creation of the fascist ideology, Mussolini influenced, or achieved admiration from, a wide variety of political figures.[PARAGRAPH:1]In June 1923, the government passed the Acerbo Law, which transformed Italy into a single national constituency. It also granted a two-thirds majority of the seats in Parliament to the party or group of parties which had obtained at least 25 percent of the votes. This law was punctually applied in the elections of April 6, 1924. The \"national alliance\", consisting of Fascists, most of the old Liberals and others, won 64 percent of the vote largely by means of violence and voter intimidation. These tactics were especially prevalent in the south. Among the domestic achievements of Mussolini from the years 1924 - 1939 were: his public works programmes such as the taming of the Pontine Marshes, the improvement of job opportunities, and public transport. Mussolini also solved the Roman Question by concluding the Lateran Treaty between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See. He is also credited with securing economic success in Italy's colonies and commercial dependencies.[PARAGRAPH:1]In an effort to realise an Italian Empire or the New Roman Empire as supporters called it, Italy set its sights on Ethiopia with an invasion that was carried out rapidly. Italy's forces were far superior to the Abyssinian forces, especially in regards to air power and were soon declared victors. Emperor Haile Selassie was forced to flee the country, with Italy entering the capital Addis Ababa to proclaim an Empire by May 1936, making Ethiopia part of Italian East Africa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although he initially favoured siding with France against Germany in the early 1930s, Mussolini became one of the main figures of the Axis powers and, on 10 June 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II on the side of Axis. Three years later, Mussolini was deposed at the Grand Council of Fascism, prompted by the Allied invasion. Soon after his incarceration began, Mussolini was rescued from prison in the daring Gran Sasso raid by German special forces.[PARAGRAPH:1]The relationship between Mussolini and Adolf Hitler was a contentious one early on. While Hitler cited Mussolini as an influence, Mussolini had little regard for Hitler, especially after the Nazis had assassinated his friend and ally, Engelbert Dollfuss the Austrofascist dictator of Austria in 1933. Both movements focused heavily on the state and conquest, though there was some conflicting views of ideology: while Hitler lauded racialism and anti-semitism, Mussolini and the Italian fascists did not. Mussolini viewed himself as a modern day Roman Emperor, a cultural elite and wished to \"Italianise\" the parts of the Italian Empire he had desired to build. A cultural superiority, rather than a view of racialism. The difference was that a culture can be learned, while a race cannot.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following his rescue, Mussolini headed the Italian Social Republic in parts of Italy that were not occupied by Allied forces. In late April, 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape to Switzerland, only to be captured and summarily executed near Lake Como by Communist Italian partisans. His body was taken to Milan where it was hung upside down at a petrol station for public viewing and to provide confirmation of his demise.</string>

The founder of the ruling dynasty was Mbire, a semi-mythical potentate active in the 13th century. Mbire's purported great-great-grandson Nyatsimba was the first ruler to assume the title of the \"owner of the Conquered Lands and Peoples\", which became hereditary among his descendants. Nyatsimba Mutota, Chief of the Karanga Tribe of the Shonas, founded the Kingdom of Monomotapa in present day Zimbabwe and Mozambique circa 1420.[PARAGRAPH:1]After 1400 one clan of the Shona tribe, the Rozwi clan, became dominant over the others. Mutota expanded northward to the Zambezi River. This prompted him to move the Shona capital from Great Zimbabwe to Khami in 1440; Khami was also closer to the gold deposits that were still being worked.

He succeeded his father Andriamiaramanjaka in 1787 and beginning in the 1790s, he began establishing control over the major part of the Madagascar island. He established civil and penal codes, distributed land, and reglemented commerce. [PARAGRAPH:1]While written accounts describe a state that was already well organised by the end of the 18th Century, a form of centralized political authority existed before that date. Nampoina expanded the Marina kingdom and the increased the slave trade from Madagascar to Mauritius and other lands. The slave trade provided weapons, and an expansion of the army, which also coincided with the development of literacy, provided by the Antaimoro people of Madagascar, who had retained some Arabic script. [PARAGRAPH:1]After succeeding in gathering all Imerina region kingdoms, Nampoina tackled challenges so as to nourish the whole population. Tools were given to peasants, markets were settled, he had dykes built so as to fit out Betsimitatatra ricefields plains. Thousands of peasants worked there. In order to encourage them and convey royal guidelines, Nampoina sent his best Mpikabary (orators), singers and dancers on building sites, roadworks and ricefields. [PARAGRAPH:1]All along the 19th century, the sovereigns of Imerina (the central Highlands of Madagascar) made it their business to extend their authority to the rest of the country. Various chiefs of clans, and later the princes of various regions, had fought to expand their territories, but the first deliberate effort to unify the country was undertaken by Nampoina. Probably due to the exceptional stature he had built for himself, his legacy acquired a sacredness that was used by all his successors to legitimise their authority. One outstanding part of that legacy was that he prescribed that royalty should be kept in the hands of his female relatives and their female descendants. Except for the transition he had accorded to his son Radama, women henceforth ruled in Madagascar: Ranavalona I (1828-1861), Rasoherina (1863-1868), Ranavalona II (1868-1883) and Ranavalona III (1883-1896). [PARAGRAPH:1]During the time of his reign, he introduced regulatory policies and structures of accountability by establishing a judicial code, banning alcohol, tobacco, and hemp, and devising a system of weights and measures.

He was not a \"chief\" of all of the Navajo, the independent minded Navajo having no central authority, but he was very influential due to his status in the tribe, gained from both his wealth, high personal reputation and age at the time he negotiated with the Americans.[PARAGRAPH:1]Narbona had become one of the most prominent leaders in the aftermath of the massacre of 24 Navajo leaders in March 1822 at Jemez Pueblo who had been travelling under flag of truce to a peace conference with the new Mexican government. In February 1829 he lead the Navajo in battle against a Mexican expedition into the Chuska Mountains led by Captain Blas de Hinojos and defeated it utterly. The site of the battle, Copper Pass (Beesh Lichii'I Bigiizh), is now known as Narbona Pass.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1849, Narbona had ridden with several hundred of his warriors to meet with a delegation led by Col. John M. Washington to discuss terms for peace between the Navajo and the \"New Men\", Americans who had driven the Mexicans from what is now the Southwestern United States. The US party was composed of both US Regulars and local New Mexican auxiliaries.[PARAGRAPH:1]After several misunderstandings, translators managed to work out an acceptable list of terms for peace between the two parties. As the peace council broke up, Sadoval, a young Navajo warrior of some distinction, began riding his horse to and fro, exhorting the 200-300 Navajo warriors in attendance to break the new treaty immediately, starting with the massacre of Col. Washington's command. At this point, a New Mexican officer claimed that he noticed a horse that belonged to him being ridden by one of the Navajo warriors. Navajos were great raiders of livestock, so it is entirely possible that this horse did indeed belong to the Americans. Washington, put in the position of backing one of his troopers, demanded that the horse be immediately turned over. The Navajo refused, and the horse and its rider departed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Washington commanded his troops to unlimber their cannon and prepare to fire if the Navajo refused to return the, now absent, property the Americans were claiming was stolen. The Navajo again denied his request, and the cannon as well as some rifles were fired.[PARAGRAPH:1]Narbona was mortally wounded in the fusillade. As a final indignity, according to eyewitnesses, he was also scalped by one of the New Mexico militiamen. He was buried by his sons in the traditional Navajo fashion, bound in a \"death knotted\" blanket and cast into a crevice. Two of his finest horses were slaughtered to ensure he would not walk to the afterlife.[PARAGRAPH:1]</string>

Nasser was born on the 15th of January in 1918 in the poor Alexandrian suburb of Bacos to southern Egyptian parents. Talking about his childhood Nasser says \"I am proud to belong to this small village of Beni Morr. And I am more proud to be a member of a poor family from that village. I am saying these words for history that Nasser was born in a poor family and I promise that he will live and die a poor man.\"      Beni Morr is a small village in Upper Egypt lies in the province of Assiut. Belonging to such a place was may be the reason why Nasser always focused his thoughts on peasants. He always thought of their poverty and suffering. Nasser's father was an employee of the middle class which made Nasser more aware of poverty of the majority of the people in Egypt.      Nasser joined the military collage after the the signature of the 1936 pact which allowed lower class youth to join such a collage that they were not allowed to before this pact. He graduated in July 1938 and hence joined the Egyptian army.      Dissatisfied with the corruption of the king Farouk regime and the British occupation, together with a group of colleagues, he formed a semi-underground organization, The Free Officers, known in Egypt as El-Dhobatt El-Ahrar. He fought in the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948. Participating in this war increased his awareness of the Palestinean problem and the contemporary Arabic case.      The corruption of the government inside and the losing of the 1948 war were the main motives that made The Free Officers led by General Mohammed Naguib up rise the revolution of 23rd of July 1952. General Naguib was a respected senior officer who was only appointed as a figure-leader to enhance the credibility of the coup. On July 26, King Farouk of Egypt left Alexandria on his personal Yacht, never to return to Egypt again, and his toddler son, Ahmad Fouad, was soon declared King. The remaining British troops were asked to evacuate the country and, by 1954, the last British soldier had indeed left.      The Free Officers gradually engaged in politics during the following years. In 1953, the Free Officers deposed Ahmad Fouad, the last King, and declared Egypt a Republic, with Mohamed Naguib as its first president. Naguib, who grew up within the old system, was a courageous yet peaceful man and had no plans for radical change. So he too was deposed in 1954 by the true leader of the coup, Nasser, who became the country's head of state.      It was only when Nasser became president that the 1952 military coup started turning into a real social and political revolution, now referred to as the 1952 Revolution. Nasser was highly praised for his Nationalization of the Suez Canal, his Agrarian reform, and his socialist policies that brought the vast majority of Egyptians out of poverty.      Nasser achieved unprecedented popularity throughout the Arab world. He was admired for his rousing support of Arab Nationalism; his domestic social programmes (which, for the first time in Egypt's history, sought to better the lot of the peasant majority);       Nasser spent his life defending the Arab Nationalism and the people's right to be free. He supported liberal movements against all types of occupation in the developing countries. Nasser was a founding-leader of the Nonaligned movement. Along with India's Nehru and Indonesia's Sukarno, Nasser became a major international power-broker in the politics of the developing world.      Shortly after the defeat 1967, Nasser resigned, but thousands of Cairenes marched in his support. For the next three years, Nasser did his best to rebuild the Egyptian army and he almost succeeded. His death in 1970 of serious health complications sent shock waves throughout the Arab world. In a stunning display of emotion, millions of Egyptians followed his funeral procession through the streets of Cairo.</string>

He is mentioned in Thai literature. The king of the Toungoo dynasty (reigned 1551-81) in Myanmar. He unified his country and conquered the Shan States and Siam (now Thailand), making Myanmar the most powerful kingdom in mainland Southeast Asia.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1550 a revolt broke out among the Mons of southern Myanmar, and Bayint Naung's brother-in-law, Tabinshwehti, was assassinated at Pegu in 1551 by a Mon prince. Bayint Naung marched to Toungoo, eliminated a pretender to the throne, and proclaimed himself king; then he marched south, captured the city of Pegu, and executed the rebel leader, Smim Htaw. The other Mon rulers then surrendered, and the revolt was at an end. Bayint Naung made Pegu his capital, as Tabinshwehti had. He later captured the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya and brought the Siamese royal family to Myanmar as hostages. Bayint Naung was the king whose army razed Ayutthaya. Some historical accounts say his savage invasion was provoked by the king of  Siam's refusal to gift him a white elephant.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bayint Naung was a patron of Buddhism; he built pagodas, gave generous donations to monasteries, and maintained extensive diplomatic relations with the Buddhist kingdom of Ceylon. Another great pagoda in Bago is Mahaceti built by Bayinnaung, most probably the wealthiest king in Myanmar history. According to historical records, fabulous treasures including the life-size gold statues of the extended imperial family were enshrined in it in addition to the usual sacred relics. Whether these treasures still remain intact inside the pagoda is a million dollar question. The sad fact is that the pagoda had lain in ruins for centuries before it was restored to its old grandeur recently. When Pegu was burned in a Mon revolt in 1564, he rebuilt it on an even grander scale, making one of the richest cities in Southeast Asia.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_NESTOR_PEDIA">[H1]Nestor[\H1][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH: 1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Nestor was an Argonaut, helped fight the centaurs, and participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar. He and his sons, Antilochus and Thrasymedes, fought on the side of the Achaeans in the Trojan War. Though Nestor was already old when the war began, he was noted for his bravery and speaking abilities. In the Iliad, he often gives advice to the younger warriors and advises Agamemnon and Achilles to reconcile. He is too old to engage in combat himself, but he leads the Pylian troops, riding his chariot, and one of his horses is killed by an arrow shot by Paris. He also had a solid gold shield. Homer frequently calls him by the epithet \"the Gerenian horseman.\" At the funeral games of Patroclus, Nestor advises Antilochus on how to win the chariot race. Antilochus was later killed in battle by Memnon.  In the Odyssey, Nestor has safely returned to Pylos, whereto Odysseus's son Telemachus travels to inquire about the fate of his father. Nestor receives Telemachus kindly and entertains him lavishly but is unable to furnish any information on his father's fate. Also appearing in the Odyssey are Nestor's wife Eurydice (a mythological figure separate from Orpheus's wife of the same name) and their remaining living sons: Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, Thrasymedes and Peisistratus. Nestor also had a daughter named Polycaste.  In the Odyssey, too, Homer's admiration of Nestor is tempered by some humor at his expense: Telemachus, having returned to Nestor's home from a visit to Helen of Troy and Menelaus  (where he has sought further information on his father's fate), urges Peisistratus to let him board his vessel immediately to return home rather than being subjected to a further dose of Nestor's rather overwhelming sense of hospitality.  Nestors advice in the Iliad has also been interpreted to have sinister undertones. For example, when Patroclus comes to Nestor for advice in Book 11, Nestor persuades him that it is urgent for him to disguise himself as Achilles. Karl Reinhardt, in Die Iliad und ihr Dichter, argues that this is contrary to what Patroclus really originally wanted  in fact, he is only there to receive information on behalf of Achilles about the wounded Machaon.  Reinhardt notes that an unimportant errand left behind by an all-important onePatrocles role as messenger is crucial and an ironic purpose permeates the encounter.  It is interesting to note that Homer offers contradictory portrayals of Nestor as a source of advice. On one hand, Homer portrays Nestor as a wise man; Nestor repeatedly offers advice to the Achaeans that has been claimed to be anachronistic in Homers time  e.g. arranging the armies by tribes and clans or effectively using chariots in battle.  Yet at the same time Nestors advice is frequently ineffective. Some examples include Nestor completely buying into the dream Zeus plants in Agamemnon in Book 2 and urging the Achaeans to battle, instructing the Achaeans in Book 4 to use spear techniques that in actuality would be disastrous, and in Book 11 giving advice to Patroclus that ultimately leads to his death. Yet Nestor is never questioned and instead is frequently praised.  Hanna Roisman, in Nestor the Good Counselor, explains that the characters in the Iliad ignore the discrepancy between the quality of Nestors advice and its outcomes is because, in the world of the Iliad, outcomes are ultimately in the hands of the ever arbitrary and fickle godsheroes are not necessarily viewed as responsible when things go awry. In the Iliad, people are judged not necessarily in the modern view of results, but as people.  Therefore, Nestor should be viewed as a good counselor because of the qualities he possesses as described in his introduction in Book 1  as a man of sweet words, a clear-voiced orator, and whose voice flows sweeter than honey.  These are elements that make up Nestor, and they parallel the elements that Homer describes as part of a good counselor in Book 3.150-152. Therefore, the definition tells us that Nestor, as a good advisor, possesses the three featuresthat it designates.  Nestor is a good counselor inherently, and the consequences of his advice have no bearing on that, a view that differs from how good counselors are viewed today.Excavations in the late 20th century in Pylos uncovered a wine cellar reportedly belonging to King Nestor. The cellar had an estimated capacity of 1,250 gallons with several remnants of pithoi, large Greek storage jars.  The National Museum of Athens displays a two-handled wine cup made of pure gold that legend ascribes as belonging to Nestor.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_NIALL_PEDIA">[H1]Niall Noigíallach[\H1][BOLD]High King of Ireland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.342 - c.450 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Niall of the Nine Hostages (Irish: Niall Noigíallach) was a High King of Ireland who was active in the early-to-mid 5th century AD, dying - according to the latest estimates - around 450/455. He is said to have made raids on the coastlines of Britannia and Gaul: according to some hagiographical sources, he is said to have kidnapped Saint Patrick and brought him to Ireland as a boy during these raids.[PARAGRAPH:1]The fourth and youngest son of Eochaid Mugmedon, an Irish High King, and Cairenn, the enslaved daughter of a British king, he was the eponymous ancestor, through his sons Conall Gulban, Endae, Eogan, Coirpre, Loegaire, Maine of Tethba, Conall Cremthainne and Fiachu Fiachach, of the Uí Neill dynasties.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to legend, Niall was the son of the High King Eochaid Mugmedon and his second wife, Cairenn, daughter of Sachell Balb, king of Britain. When Cairenn became pregnant, Eochaid's first wife, Mongfind, was consumed with jealousy and made Cairenn do heavy work in the hope of forcing her to miscarry. Out of fear of Mongfind, Cairenn exposed her baby, but he was rescued and fostered by Torna the poet. Niall returned to Tara as an adult and rescued his mother from the heavy labour Mongfind had imposed on her.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mongfind demanded that Eochaid name a successor, hoping it would be one of her sons. Eochaid gave the task to a druid, Sithchenn, who devised a contest between the brothers, shutting them in a burning forge, telling them to save what they could, and judging them based on the objects with which they emerged. Niall, who emerged carrying an anvil, was deemed greater than Brion, with a sledgehammer, Fiachrae with bellows and a pail of beer, Ailill with a chest of weapons, and Fergus with a bundle of wood. Mongfind refused to accept the decision.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sithchenn made the five brothers weapons and they went out hunting. Each brother in turn went looking for water, and found a well guarded by a hideous hag who demanded a kiss in return for water. Fergus and Ailill refused and returned empty-handed. Fiachra gave her a peck, but not enough to satisfy her. Only Niall kissed her properly, and she was revealed as a beautiful maiden, the Sovereignty of Ireland. She granted Niall not only water but the kingship for many generations. Fiachra was granted a minor royal line. After that, Mongfind's sons deferred to Niall.[PARAGRAPH:1]There are various versions of how Niall gained his epithet Noígiallach. The oldest is that he took a hostage from each of the nine tuatha or petty kingdoms of the Airgialla. The later, better known story is that he took a hostage from each of the five provinces of Ireland (Ulster, Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Meath), and one each from the Scots, Saxons, Britons, and French (or one each from Dalriada, Caledonia, Strathclyde and Northumbria).[PARAGRAPH:1]Irish sources describe Niall's expeditions to Britain and France, and his reign, as given in the Irish Annals, is roughly contemporaneous with the foundation of Dalriada in Scotland by Irish migrants and the raids by \"Scots\" on late Roman and post-Roman Britain.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to later tradition, during one of his many raids on Britain, Niall captured the future Saint Patrick and brought him in bondage to Ireland. Many years later Patrick suceeded in escaping to Britain, but he eventually returned to Ireland and played an important early role in the conversion of the Irish to Christianity.[PARAGRAPH:1]The traditional date for Niall's death is ca. 405, but many modern historians prefer a later date, about 450 or 455. There are various traditions regarding the circumstances of his death. The earliest has him dying at sea in the English Channel, at the hands of the Leinster king Eochaid mac Enna, as he was attempting a raid on Armorica (modern Brittany) in Roman Gaul. Other sources say he died in battle against the Picts in Scotland, or even in the Alps. All traditions agree that he died outside of Ireland. According to legend his followers carried his body back to Ireland, fighting seven battles along the way, and whenever they carried Niall's body before them they were unbeatable.</string>

The name Nimi a Lukeni appeared in later oral traditions and some modern historians, notably Jean Cuvelier, popularized it. Nimi became the founder of Kongo when, around 1400, he moved his capital to Mbanza Kongo on a mountain that lay to the south and was conquered from Mwene Kabunga (or Mwene Mpangala) whose descendants symbolically challenged the conquest annually two centuries later.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was the offpsring of his father Nimi and the Mwene Mbata's daughter, according to traditions recorded by Giovanni Cavazzi da Montecuccolo in the mid 17th century. Although he probably ruled in the valley of the Kwilu River in modern day Democratic Republic of Congo, he is credited with conquering the region of modern day Mbanza Kongo, displacing a localruler named Mwene Mpangala and building his capital there. He probably ruled in the late 14th century.[PARAGRAPH:1]In Jesuit-authored accounts, Lukeni lua Nimi is presented as a conqueror who came from the north, on the other side of the Congo River. In one account, he was the younger son of a king, unlikely to succeed to power after his father, and seeking a new kingdom of his own. In another account, he commits a dreadful double homicide, stabbing his pregnant mother through the womb; then, gathering his followers, who are encouraged rather than repelled by this gruesome murder, he conquers Kongo.[PARAGRAPH:1]People speaking ancient versions of Kikongo probably arrived in the region from the north as part of the larger Bantu migration. They were practicing agriculture by at least 1000 BC, and working iron by at least 400 BC.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_NUWAS_PEDIA">[H1]Yusuf Dhu Nuwas[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Last king of the Himyarite kingdom of Yemen[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ruled: [\BOLD] 517 - 525[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Yusuf Dhu Nuwas was the last king of the Himyarite kingdom of Yemen and a convert to Judaism.  Some sources state that he was the successor of Rabia ibn Mudhar, a member of the same dynasty; the archeologist Alessandro de Maigret believes he was an usurper.  According to a number of medieval historians, who depend on the account of John of Ephesus, Dhu Nuwas, who was a convert to Judaism, announced that he would persecute the Christians living in his kingdom because Christian states persecuted his fellow co-religionists in their realms; a letter survives written by Simon, the bishop of Beth Arsham in 524 CE, recounts Dhu Nuwas' (where he is called Dimnon) persecution in Najran (modern al-Ukhdud in Saudi Arabia).  The persecution is apparently described and condemned in the Qur'an (al-Buruj:4).  According to the contemporary sources, after seizing the throne of the Himyarites, in ca. 518 or 523 Dhu Nuwas attacked the Aksumite (mainly Christian) garrison at Zafar, capturing them and burning their churches. He then moved against Najran, a Christian and Aksumite stronghold. After accepting the city's capitulation, he massacred those inhabitants who would not renounce Christianity. Estimates of the death toll from this event range up to 20,000 in some sources.  Dhu Nuwas then proceeded to write a letter to the Lakhmid king Mundhir of al-Hira and King Kavadh I of Persia, informing them of his deed and encouraging them to do likewise to the Christians under their dominion. Al-Mundhir received this letter in January 519 as he was receiving an embassy from Constantinople seeking to forge a peace between the Roman Empire and Hira. He revealed the contents of the letter to the Roman ambassadors who were horrified at its contents. Word of the slaughter quickly spread throughout the Rom an and Persian realms, and refugees from Najran even reached the court of the Roman emperor Justin I himself, begging him to avenge the martyred Christians.  The slaughter of the Axumite garrison in Zafar also provoked a response from Kaleb, King of Axum. Procopius reports that Kaleb (whom he calls Hellesthaeus) with the help of Justin, the Roman Emperor, collected a fleet and crossed from Africa to Yemen, where he defeated Dhu Nuwas about the year 520 or 525 (1.20). Kaleb then appointed his Christian South Arabian follower Sumuafa' Ashawa' to rule Yemen as his viceroy.  Arab tradition states that Dhu Nuwas committed suicide by riding his horse into the Red Sea. De Maigret reports that another South Arabian inscription from Husn al-Ghurab may indicate that he was killed in battle fighting against Kaleb's army.  De Maigret also reports that in 1951, three inscriptions were found just north of al-Ukhdud, which refer to a military campaign led by Dhu Nuwas (where he is called Yusuf Asar Yathar), and are dated to the year 633 of the Himyarite era, equivalent to AD 518 or 523.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_OBASANJO_PEDIA">[H1]Obasanjo[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]12th President of Nigeria[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1937 - [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]General (rtd.) Chief Olusegun Aremu Okikiola Matthew Obasanjo  is a retired Nigerian Army General and former President of Nigeria. A Christian of Yoruba descent, Obasanjo was a career soldier before serving twice as his nation's head of state, once as a military ruler and again as elected President. The military regimes of Murtala Muhammad and Obasanjo benefited from a tremendous influx of oil revenue that increased 350 percent between 1973 and 1974, when oil prices skyrocketed, to 1979, when the military stepped down. Increased revenues permitted massive spending; this spending, however, was poorly planned and concentrated in urban areas. The oil boom was marred by a minor recession in 1978-79, but revenues rebounded until mid-1981. The increase in revenues made possible a rapid rise in income, especially for the urban middle class. There was a corresponding inflation, particularly in the price of food, that promoted both industrialisation and the expansion of agricultural production. As a result of the shift to food crops, the traditional export earners - peanuts, cotton, cocoa, and palm products - declined in significance and then ceased to be important at all. Nigeria's exports became dominated by oil.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the dictatorship of Sani Abacha (1993 - 1998), Obasanjo spoke out against the human rights abuses of the regime, and was imprisoned with the claim of planning a coup. He was released only after Abacha's sudden death on 8 June 1998. It was after his release from prison that Obasanjo announced that he was a born-again Christian. In the 1999 elections, the first in sixteen years, he decided to run for the presidency as the candidate of the People's Democratic Party. Obasanjo won with 62.6% of the vote, sweeping the strongly Christian Southeast and the predominantly Muslim north, but decisively lost his home region, the Southwest, to his fellow-Yoruba and Christian, Olu Falae, the only other candidate. It is thought that lingering resentment among his fellow-Yorubas about his previous military administration of 1976 to 1979, after which he handed power over to a government dominated by northerners rather than by Yorubas, contributed to his poor showing among his own people. May 29, the day Obasanjo took office as the first elected and civilian head of state in Nigeria after 16 years of military rule, is now commemorated as Democracy Day, a public holiday in Nigeria.[PARAGRAPH:1]Obasanjo was re-elected in 2003 in a tumultuous election that had violent ethnic and religious overtones, his main opponent (fellow former military ruler General Muhammadu Buhari) being a Muslim who drew his support mainly from the north. Capturing 61.8% of the vote, Obasanjo defeated Buhari by more than 11 million votes. In 2005 the international community gave Nigeria's government its first pass mark for its anti-corruption efforts. However, a growing number of critics within Nigeria have accused Obasanjo's government of selectively targeting his anti-corruption drive against political opponents and ethnic militants, ignoring growing concerns about wide-scale corruption within his own inner political circle.</string>

Although he was the third Supreme Director of Chile (1817-23), O'Higgins was the first holder of this title to head a fully independent Chilean state. When his father Ambrose O'Higgins became Viceroy of Peru, Bernardo was sent to a Catholic school in London to complete his studies.There, Bernardo became acquainted with American-independist ideas: he knew Venezuelan Francisco de Miranda and joined the Masonic Logia Lautaro.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1810, he joined the nationalist rebels fighting for independence from Spain. In 1814, his Chilean rebels were defeated by the Spanish and retreated into the Andes. In 1817, O'Higgins went back on the offensive with the aid of Argentine General José de San Martín. On February 12, 1817, he led a cavalry charge that won the Battle of Chacabuco. He became the first leader of independent Chile, and was granted dictatorial powers as Supreme Director on February 16, 1817. On February 12, 1818, Chile was proclaimed an independent republic.[PARAGRAPH:1]His six-year rule saw the founding of the Military Academy and the approval of the new (and current) Chilean flag. However, his more radical and liberal reforms, (such as the establishment of democracy and abolition of nobility titles) were resisted by the powerful conservative large-land owners. During his government, he founded the cities of La Union and Vicuna. From his later exile in Peru, he promoted the Chilean expansion southward, concluding in the foundation of Punta Arenas in 1845. Also, his government was involved in the killing of adversary independist leaders Jose Miguel Carrera, his brothers Juan José and Luis in Argentina, and Carreras' friend and guerrilla leader Manuel Rodriguez. He was deposed by a conservative coup on January 28, 1823.[PARAGRAPH:1]During his government, he also assisted Jose de San Martin to organize the Expedition and an Army and Navy to support the Independence of Peru.

The Ashanti were a powerful, warlike, and highly disciplined people of West Africa, whose history goes back more than 2000 years. The Ashanti are said to be the descendants of those Ethiopians mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus who were driven southward by a conquering Egyptian army. Osei Tutu led an alliance of Ashanti states against the regional hegemon, the Denkyira, completely defeating them. Then, through force of arms and diplomacy, he induced the rulers of the other Ashanti city-states to declare allegiance to Kumasi, his capital. Through his career he was closely advised by Okomfo Anokye, his chief Priest.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Empire of Ashanti was officially formed in 1701 and Osei Tutu was crowned Asantehene (King of all Ashanti). He would hold that position until his death in 1717 in a battle against the Akyem.Osei Tutu was the fourth ruler in Asante royal history, succeeding his uncle Obiri Yeboa. The Asante comprise the largest contingent of the Akan or Twi-speaking peoples. Akan societies are matrilineal, with a person belonging to the abusua of his mother. Inheritance, succession and status are lineally determined. Osei Tutu belonged to the Oyoko Abusua.[PARAGRAPH:1]Osei Tutu, assisted by Okomfo Anokye, developed a new constitution for the Union. The Asantahene, who was also the Kumasihene, was at its head, with the kings of the states of the union forming the Confederacy or Union Council. While the power of the asantehene was not absolute, Osei Tutu enjoyed much despotic power. He is arguably one of the most significant black kings in history. He more than tripled the size of his empire through wars of conquest, and expansion, and he brought a sense of dignity back to West Africa.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the Asante Union firmly established and its military organization in place, Osei Tutu embraced on wars of expansion and revenge. Skillfully utilizing a combination of spiritual dogma and political skill, and ably supported by military prowess, Osei Tutu tripled the size of the small kingdom of Kumasi which he had inherited from his uncle Obiri Yeoba and laid the foundation for the Empire of Ashanti in the process.[PARAGRAPH:1]After avenging his uncle's death at the hands of the Dormaa and bringing some recalcitrant states into line, Osei Tutu focused on the Denkyira. In 1701, the absolute defeat of the Denkyira and their abettors, the people of Akyem, brought the Asante to the attention of the Europeans on the coast for the first time. The victory broke the Denkyira hold on the trade path to the coast and cleared the way for the Asante to increase trade with the Europeans.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1717, Osei Tutu was killed in a war against the Akyem. He was struck by bullets from snipers and sharpshooters, who were hiding in the dense forests and the trees as he crossed a river in a canoe.</string>

His leadership provided a much-needed Indian alliance for the British colonial settlements in much of present day West Virginia and beyond. Ostenaco led the fight against Ohio Valley Indians who were allied with the French and attacking settlements in the areas of the Tygart Valley, Greenbrier River, and North and South Branches of the Potomac River. With Major Andrew Lewis he led an expedition against the Shawnee along the Big Sandy River area that ended in failure but forged a lasting friendship with Lewis. His allegiance with such Virginia leaders contributed significantly to the expansion of English-speaking peoples into what is now West Virginia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ostenaco was famous in Cherokee society for his military achievement as well as his diplomacy. His war title was Outacite or Man-Killer. During the French and Indian War (1754 - 1763), fought for control of North American trade and land, the Cherokee allied themselves with the British against the French and their Northern Indian allies. However conflict between the Cherokee and British followed with the siege on Fort Loudoun in East Tennessee. Ostenaco, the great orator, eventually made peace with a representative of colonial Virginia, Henry Timberlake, who visited for several months. Timberlake then took him and two other chiefs to visit London and King George III.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1754, the first shots in the bloody 7 year brawl known today as the French and Indian War were fired. The war embroiled several North American nations in a struggle for control of the eastern third of the continent. In the summer of 1755, English General Edward Braddock alienated Ohio Valley Iroquois, Delaware, and Shawnee allies and reaped a just reward by losing soundly to a numerically inferior army of Indians and Frenchmen near the forks of Ohio River.[PARAGRAPH:1]This loss unleashed the fury of French and Amerindian warriors against the English colonists in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. The colonies requested assistance from southern Amerindians, traditional enemies of the northerners, and the response from the Cherokees was swift and strong. Mankiller Ostenaco led 130 warriors against the Shawnees in the winter of 1756. The Cherokee campaign failed by the addition of a slow-moving, hunger-ridden, infighting Virginian army. However, a strong friendship between Mankiller Ostenaco and Mjr. Andrew Lewis ensured the steady support the colonies needed from the Cherokees.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ostenaco recruited warriors, led war parties, and conducted diplomatic missions. His efforts ensured that the colonies defensive war was complemented by effective offensive maneuvers carried to the very gates of the enemy's Ohio Valley strongholds. The Cherokee offensive campaign paved the way for the Reverand Post's peace mission to the Ohio Valley Indians, and this led to the relatively unopposed march of General Forbes army to the ruins of Fort Duquesne (present-day Pittsburgh) late in 1758.</string>

Ovonramwen Nogbaisi came to be the Oba of Benin in 1888.  At the end of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Benin had managed to retain its independence and the Oba exercised a monopoly over trade which the British found irksome. The territory was coveted by an influential group of investors for its rich natural resources such as palm-oil, rubber and ivory. In 1892, Ovonramwen signed a treaty placing Benin under British protection, and undertaking to abolish the slave trade. The kingdom remained largely independent of British control, however, and pressure continued from figures such as Vice-Consul James Robert Phillips and Captain Gallwey (the British vice-Consul of Oil Rivers Protectorate) who were pushing for British annexation of the Benin Empire and the removal of the Oba.  A British contingent headed by Phillips went to visit the Oba in 1896 despite several warnings that Ovonramwen was unable to see them due to ceremonial duties. Having been warned on several further occasions on the way, Phillips sent his stick to the Oba, a deliberate insult designed to provoke the conflict that would provide an excuse for British annexation. Phillip's expedition was ambushed and all but two were killed. Subsequently a military operation against Benin in 1897 led by [Harry Rawson] resulted in the burning of Benin City and the deaths of untold numbers of its inhabitants.

This was the first of a series of raids on Rhuddlan, Flint, Holt, Oswestry and Welshpool. Glyndwr was outlawed but many of his followers sought successfully to be pardoned.  As support for Glyndwr grew, students made violent demonstrations and exiles returned to Wales to join him. Glyndwr forged alliances with Scotland and France, captured a number of castles and held a Parliament in Machynlleth.  In Harlech he held a court and planned a future for Wales. But, by the time he occupied most of Wales everyone was terrified of him.  Glyndwr fought on until he was cornered at his last castle, Harlech. No details of the siege survive, but he escaped. His wife, two daughters and a grandchild were captured and imprisoned until their deaths in London.  Glyndwr lived his remaining years with his son-in-law Sir John Skydmore at Kenturch. In 1415, he refused the offer of a pardon. His death remains a mystery and it is still uncertain where he was buried.Today, feelings are mixed about Glyndwr and the strategies he used. He was said to have breached rules of war and burnt down Oswestry and Handbridge, Chester, so frequently that they became known as Burnttowns.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_PAEZ_PEDIA">[H1]José Antonio Páez[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Venezuela[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1790 - 1873[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Páez was born in Curpa, Portuguesa State in Venezuela. His paternal grandmother, Luisa Antonia de Mendoza and Mota, was daughter of Luís Rodríguez de Mendoza, a native of Icod de los Vinos, Tenerife (Canary Island). He was of humble origins, his father being a low level employee of the colonial government. As a boy he was forced to work like a slave. By the age of 20, his father already died, Páez was married and earning a living by trading cattle.  Late in 1810, he joined a cavalry squadron, led by a former employer, set up with the purpose of fighting the colonial government. In 1813, he asked for leave from his squadron with the intent of setting and leading his own, which he did, joining the Western Republican Army with the rank of sergeant. Páez had an ingratiating personality which made him very much liked amongst those who knew him. He was also looked up to for his skills as a horseman and for his physical capabilities.Páez, a soldier at heart, started moving up the ranks by winning year after year several engagements against the royalists with his band of marauding llaneros (plainsmen). He came to be known by the nicknames of \"El Centauro de los Llanos\" (The Centaur of the Plains), and \"El León de Payara\" (The Lion of Payara) or (The Lion of Apure).  Páez had been leading the fighting in the plains while Simón Bolívar was busy with the eastern part of the country. Early in 1818, both men met to discuss better coordination of their efforts. After shortly fighting in the center of the country, Páez was ordered to go back to the western plains, where he took from the Spanish the city of San Fernando in Apure.  Páez won all of six major battles that he led by himself, the most celebrated one being the Battle of Las Queseras del Medio.  Late in 1820, an armistice had been signed with the Spanish commander and a temporary suspension of hostilities had taken place. However, ongoing developments were making difficult to maintain the armistice and, consequently, it was agreed it would lapse on 28 April 1821.  All five major fighting groups of the Venezuelan army were to start moving towards a central area. Some with the purpose of joining together in one single group and others with the intention of guarding the approach to that region to prevent royalists units from other far away areas from converging and reinforcing the main Spanish army stationed in the same area.  In early June 1821, the 6,500 men republican army was divided and organized in three divisions. The 1st division, made up of 2,500 men, was under Páez's command and formed by two battalions: Bravos de Apure (Apure Braves) and Cazadores Britanicos (British Hunters or as more often translated to English, the British Legion) and seven cavalry regiments.  By 20 June, all three republican divisions converge from different directions in the plain of Carabobo. With the royalists well entrenched in the center and the south, on the morning of 21 June, Páez was given command of an additional cavalry regiment and ordered to take it together with his own division through the hills on the north side and into the plain and to engage the Spanish, while the 2nd division would stay behind Páez and the 3rd would remain in a defensive position waiting to engage the enemy in the center.  On seeing Páez's men move, the Spanish commander, Miguel de la Torre, orders one of his elite battalions, the Burgos, to reinforce and defend the north flank. Initially, the Spanish so fiercely engage the Bravos de Apure battalion that it had to fall back on two occasions. Páez sent his Cazadores Britanicos to help the Bravos and together they fought back the Spanish, now reinforced themselves by two additional battalions. As the fighting intensified, de la Torre sent more troops to the north. Páez then sent his cavalry further north to outflank the Spanish and come down on the plain from behind. At this moment, the battle is obviously going against the Spanish, who in desperation kept sending reinforcements. In the meantime, Páez's men were gaining terrain and closing on falling Spanish from all sides. Some of the Spanish battalions supposed to join and reinforce the engagement in the north, on seeing how their comrades are faring, decide to disobey orders and retreat. As it becomes evident that the republicans were winning the battle, the other divisions moved forward, but by now the bulk of the work had already been done by Páez and his men.  With the Battle of Carabobo, the military fate of the Spanish army in Venezuela was sealed. The victory was carried by Páez. Bolívar promoted him on site to General in Chief of the republican army.  In the battle, the Spanish lost over 65% of their men; the survivors took refuge in the castle of Puerto Cabello, which, until it was taken by Páez and his men in 1823, was the last Spanish stronghold in Venezuela territory.Following the Battle of Carabobo, Páez was named General Commander of the provinces of Caracas and Barinas (at the time they included the important regions of Caracas, Barquisimeto, Barinas and Apure).  It had been Bolivar's dream to unite the liberated Spanish provinces into a single great country: La Gran Colombia. It was made up of present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. As the war against Spain came to an end, federalist and regionalist sentiments began to arise once again.  While Bolívar was engaged in military campaigns in Peru, he was unable to carry on his duties as president of Gran Colombia. As a result, the center of power of the executive branch was in Bogotá under the leadership of Vice President Francisco de Paula Santander, from New Granada (modern-day Colombia and Panama). While some leaders saw Gran Colombia as only a military necessity, others saw it as a real administrative entity. Thus confusion arose between the central government in Bogotá and the provinces and the municipalities. This made Páez and some Venezuelan politicians uncomfortable. Then in 1826, after the Congress in Santa Fe de Bogotá under Santander found a Venezuelan hero from the independence war guilty of assassinating the French Colonel Emanuel Roergas Serviez in Colombia, Páez initiated and led a movement that became known as \"La Cosiata\" (a word that has never existed in Spanish language and that at the time was made up to refer to this movement and meaning something along the lines of \"that weird thing without a name\").  La Cosiata started in April 1826 as a quasi-spontaneous movement (as existing historical interpretations differ) of local politicians and personalities supporting Páez. There was pressure in favor of Páez's removal from his office by locals in Venezuela, who had accused him of abusing his authority in relation to implementing orders coming from Bogotá -orders which Páez himself allegedly did not agree much with-: the forced recruitment of men for the army. The Congress in Bogotá, including several of the Venezuelans among it, received the complaints coming from Venezuela, which alleged that Páez had not properly understood the extent of his orders and had exceeded them in his implementation. Congress decided that it alone could judge Páez for his actions, and ordered him to go to Bogotá for his trial.  Páez was initially willing to go. However, the irony now dictated that some of the same local personalities that were originally unhappy with Páez for implementing Santander's orders now felt insulted for their leader's having to go to Bogotá to be tried. After a few days of uncertainty and tension in the streets, the municipality of Valencia broke with Bogotá and submitted itself to Páez as military commander. In the following days, more municipalities would follow suit, including Caracas, which had been the one that first had accused Páez. Other municipalities and local officials did not join in this change of opinion.  In July, Santander declared that Páez was in open rebellion against the central government. While all this was happening, Páez wrote to Bolívar, asking him to come back to take charge and solve the imbroglio.  While Páez and his supporters were willing to have Bolívar as supreme leader, they were reluctant to follow Santander. While they wanted changes to be made to the constitution, they initially wanted to do it under Bolívar as part of the Gran Colombia.  Bolívar, finally returned from his campaigns in the south and took command of the executive towards the end of 1826 assuming the extraordinary powers granted to him by the Congress. Conflicting letters between Santander and Bolívar, and Bolívar and Páez, created a degree of uncertainty as to what his actions would be. He finally declared a general amnesty to all those that were involved in La Cosiata, notwithstanding from then on that any disobedience of his orders would be considered a crime against the state. Páez welcomed Bolívar and accepted his authority, and Bolívar named him Supreme Civil and Military Commander of Venezuela. This action confused and disappointed both Santander in Bogotá and the few local officials in Venezuela that had not supported the La Cosiata, who found themselves being removed or transferred to other posts while those that had backed Páez remained or were subsequently promoted.  Until La Cosiata, Páez had been mostly respected as a result of his military successes during the war. From now on he started to be seen as a politician with the power and the wit needed to pursue and defend any changes, or lack thereof, made under the constitutional order. Páez came out from La Cosiata with more power than he ever had before.In 1830, Páez declared Venezuela independent from Gran Colombia and became president. Although he was not the first president of Venezuela (which declared its independence from Spain in 1811 and named Cristobal Mendoza as president) he was the first head of government after the dissolution of Gran Colombia. For more than thirty years from his accession to power in 1830 to his death in 1873, Páez was the greatest figure in Venezuela and would return to rule whenever the national government failed. The government ruled by the oligarchy in the country followed the Constitution of 1830. Páez and the conservative oligarchy were conveniently allied because the oligarchy controlled a great amount of their country's wealth but was not popular with the masses where as Páez was very much liked by the masses.  The 1830s to the 1860s are thought of by historians as a golden era in Venezuela's history, in contrast to previous and future dictatorships. It must be noted however that behind the constitution stood Páez, a military caudillo and that application of the law was only possible depending on his personal prestige. But he respected the law and was not interested in personal gain as demonstrated by the common conditions in which he lived. Between 1830-1848 under the power of Páez and the oligarchy, the economic power of the church was broken and its dominance destroyed and from then on the conflict between church and state ceased to exist unlike other countries in Latin America.  In 1842, Páez arranged to have the remains of Simon Bolivar repatriated from Santa Marta, Colombia, to the Liberator's hometown of Caracas. The procession was accompanied by exuberant funeral honors before Bolivar's remains were entombed in the Cathedral of Caracas.  In 1847 President José Tadeo Monagas, who was put into power by Páez, dispersed the Congress and proclaimed himself dictator. Páez led a rebellion against him but was defeated by General Santiago Mariño in the 'Battle of the Araguatos', imprisoned, and eventually exiled. He was exiled from the country in 1850 and did not return until 1858. In 1861, he became supreme dictator and ruled only for two years before again returning to exile. He lived in New York during his years in exile and died there in 1873. Páez served as president three times, once from 18311835, 18391842 and again from 1861-1863.</string>

He got a degree in law at the Our Lady of the Rosary University in 1977. After obtaining a postgraduate degree at Harvard University in the United States, he returned to Colombia. On his return he founded a magazine called Guión and a television news program called Noticiero TV Hoy. As a regular news anchor he became a nationally known figure.  In 1982 he formally began his political career, gaining a seat on the local Bogotá council. He also specialized in press articles on the production and trafficking of cocaine, for which he gained many journalistic awards. In 1991 he was elected Senator.  He was kidnapped on 18 January 1988 in Antioquia by the Medellín drug cartel, which was pressuring the Colombian government into preventing the extradition of Pablo Escobar and other drug lords to the United States. He was found by the National Police a week later, and in March he was elected Mayor of Bogotá, a position he held until 1990. He gained a reputation for strengthening security and reducing crime.In 1994 he stood for the presidency against Liberal candidate Ernesto Samper, losing by only 2 points in the second round. Pastrana immediately accused Samper of using drug money to finance his campaign, and provided audio recordings to the authorities which subsequently attracted much media attention and eventually led to a scandal known as 8.000 Process (Proceso 8.000).  While this accusation underwent a parliamentary investigation, Pastrana retired into his private life. In 1998, Pastrana announced his intention to run for President. This time he won in the Presidential elections of 1998.  His presidency is remembered first for his negotiations with the two left-wing guerrilla groups FARC and ELN, culminating in the grant of a demilitarized safe haven to the guerrillas the size of Switzerland, and second for his breaking off said negotiations. It is also remembered for a growing degree of unpopularity in polls as his term progressed. Some critics accused him of possibly accepting unspecified bribes from leading FARC and ELN members, but no concrete evidence of that was presented during his presidency. His administration proposed and initially oversaw the implementation of the Plan Colombia aid package and anti-drug strategy. He was also heavily criticized for all the seemingly pleasure trips he took around the world during his term.In 2005 President Álvaro Uribe Vélez, who had been a critic of Pastrana's peace process with the FARC and had received criticisms from Pastrana regarding his negotiations with Colombian paramilitary groups, surprisingly offered the former president the post of Ambassador to the United States in Washington DC. After consulting his family and political supporters, Pastrana accepted.  Some political analysts theorized that Uribe considered that Pastrana would be a useful diplomat in Washington, because he would help to renegotiate Plan Colombia and in general to maintain U.S. aid to Colombia, which has contributed to the successes of the Uribe administration.  In July 2006, a few days after President Uribe had appointed former president Ernesto Samper as Colombian ambassador to France, Pastrana told the President that he was \"morally impeded\" from participatibng in a government along with ex-president Samper. Pastrana resigned and returned to Colombia and Samper rejected his own appointment. But this move was not well received by the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party was committed to President Uribe (who won the presidency as a independent) and left former President Pastrana alone.</string>

Until February 2006 he was the leader of the Jamaican People's National Party. The new PNP leader, Portia Simpson-Miller, took over as Prime Minister on 30 March 2006.[PARAGRAPH:1]Patterson was Jamaica's longest-serving Prime Minister. He first entered politics in 1969, winning a by-election to a seat in western Jamaica, campaigning with the slogan \"Young, gifted, and black\". Patterson served in a variety of cabinet posts under Prime Minister Michael Manley, both in the 1970s, and during Manley's second prime ministership at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s. He became Prime Minister and leader of the People's National Party himself when Manley resigned in 1992. Prior to the resignation Patterson was tied to a controversial scandal but miraculously led the party to victory in the three successive elections, an unprecedented record in Jamaican electoral history.[PARAGRAPH:1]His years as Prime Minister were marked by persistent allegations of corruption. His terms in office have seen a worsening in almost all aspects of Jamaican society, including: a markedly weakened economy, an alarmingly high rate of crime and violence and, most notably, a significant decline in the quality of education. He made headlines in 2004 when it was announced that Jamaica (as well as Saint Kitts and Nevis and Venezuela) would not recognize the internationally-installed government of Gérard Latortue in Haiti following the alleged resignation of Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Patterson was instrumental in arranging for Aristide to take up temporary residence in Jamaica during Aristide's lawsuit against the United States and France accusing the countries of kidnapping him.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following Hurricane Katrina Patterson offered 30 trips for two, all expenses paid, to Jamaica for victims of the hurricane.</string>

Combined with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations, and in international diplomacy, Pearson can safely be regarded as one of the most influential Canadians of the twentieth century.[PARAGRAPH:1]After teaching university, he embarked on a career in the Department of External Affairs. He had a distinguished career as a diplomat, including playing an important part in founding both the United Nations and NATO. During World War II, he once served as a courier with the codename \"Mike\". He was appointed Secretary of State for External Affairs in the government of Liberal Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent in 1948. Pearson won a seat in the Canadian House of Commons, for the federal riding of Algoma East shortly afterward. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in defusing the Suez Crisis through the United Nations. The selection committee claimed that Pearson had \"saved the world\". The United Nations Peacekeeping Force was Pearson's creation, and he is considered the father of the modern concept of peacekeeping.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pearson led the Liberals to a minority government in the 1963 general election, and became prime minister. He had campaigned during the election promising \"60 Days of Decision\" and support for the Bomarc missile program.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pearson never had a majority in the Canadian House of Commons, but he introduced important social programs (including universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans), and the Maple Leaf Flag. Pearson's government instituted much of the modern welfare state in Canada, due in part to support for his minority government in the House of Commons from the New Democratic Party, led by Tommy Douglas. His actions included instituting the 40-hour work week, 2 weeks vacation time, and a new minimum wage.[PARAGRAPH:1]It should be noted that such policies did not prevent a strong economy. Pearson signed the Canada-United States Automotive Agreement (or Auto Pact) in January of 1965, and unemployment fell to its lowest rate in over a decade.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pearson also started a number of Royal Commissions, including one on the status of women and another on bilingualism. They instituted changes that helped create legal equality for women, and brought official bilingualism into being. After Pearson, French was made an official language, and the Canadian government would provide services in both. Pearson himself had hoped that he would be the last unilingual Prime Minister of Canada, and indeed fluency in both English and French became an unofficial requirement for Prime Ministeral candidates after Pearson left office.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pearson was also remarkable for instituting the world's first race-free immigration system, throwing out previous ones that had discriminated against certain people, such as Jews and the Chinese. His points-based system encouraged immigration to Canada, and a similar system is still in place today. Pearson also oversaw Canada's centennial celebrations in 1967 before retiring. The Canadian news agency, Canadian Press, named him \"Newsmaker of the Year\" that year, citing his leadership during the centennial celebrations, which brought the Centennial Flame on Parliament Hill.</string>

His father Pedro I abdicated the throne on April 7, 1831, after violent protests in Brazil against his careless handling of internal affairs, to fight a civil war in Portugal. The aim of the war in Portugal was to restore the throne of Portugal to Maria II, older sister of Pedro II. As a result of caring for his children's interests, in 1834, the warrior father Pedro I had a daughter of 15 on the throne of Portugal and a son of 9 Pedro II who was emperor of Brazil.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pedro II ruled Brazil for 49 years under the slogan \"União e Indústria\" (Union and Industry). The period saw the beginnings of industrialization, the first paved roads, the first steam-engine railway, a submarine telegraphy cable, and the introduction of the telephone. Liberal in outlook, Pedro II took steps to end slavery; the final abolition edict, the Golden Law, was signed in his absence by his daughter Princess Isabel, on May 13, 1888. Pedro II also took pains to learn Guarani, the most widely spoken indigenous language in nineteenth-century Brazil. He was widely respected by Brazilians of all social levels as an enlightened monarch who ruled in a principled, rational, moderate fashion.[PARAGRAPH:1]Though reputed to be an enlightened monarch, Pedro II nonetheless retained extensive power over the Brazilian government. Under the Brazilian Constitution of 1824, the emperor possessed Poder Moderator (Moderating Power), i.e. the power to temper the will of Brazil's representative government. In practice, this meant that Pedro II had the right to veto legislation, dissolve the lower house of the legislature (the only one that was elected), and call new elections at his pleasure. Pedro II generally respected the wishes of the electorate, but his favoritism towards the Conservative party in 1868 marred his reputation for evenhandedness. The unexpectedly long and costly Paraguayan War of 1865-1870 also diminished his popularity.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pedro II died on December 5, 1891 in Paris, France. His and his wife's remains were taken to Brazil in 1922, and were reburied in Petropolis, their former summer residence, in 1939.</string>

Peron and his wife Eva were popular among a portion of the Argentine people, particularly because of their efforts to eliminate poverty and to dignify labour. He started the political movement known as Peronism, still popular in Argentina to this day, which professes to be a third way in between capitalism and socialism.[PARAGRAPH:1]In May 1943, as a colonel, he was a significant figure in the military coup by the GOU (United Officers' Group), a secret society, against the conservative civilian government of Ramón Castillo. Initially secretary to Secretary of War General Edelmiro Farrell, under the administration of General Pedro Ramirez, he later became the head of the then-insignificant Department of Labor. Peron's growing power and influence during the military government came from his alliance with a sector of the Argentine labor unions. [PARAGRAPH:1]The popular support gained Peron the presidency in 1946. Peron pursued social policies aimed at empowering the working class. He greatly expanded the number of unionized workers, and helped establish the powerful General Confederation of Labour (CGT), created in 1930. He called this the \"third position\", between capitalism and communism. Perón also pushed hard to industrialize the country; in 1947 he announced the first five-year plan to boost newly nationalized industries. His ideology would be dubbed Peronism and became a central influence in Argentine political parties.[PARAGRAPH:1]The improvement of the laborers' situation created, in the middle and high classes, a strong feeling against the new industrial workers coming from the rural areas who were treated formerly as servants. In the 1940s the middle and high class students were the first group to oppose Peronist workers, using the slogan: \"peon-footwear [=espadrilles] dictatorship, NO!\" (\"No a la dictadura de las alpargatas\"). Another famous painting revealing the strong oposition between peronists and anti-peronist appeared at the high class districts in the 1950s saying, \"Long live cancer!\" (Viva el cáncer!), when Eva Peron was dying because of the cancer. [PARAGRAPH:1]In contrast to his alleged right-wing tendencies, he resisted the entreaties of the military in 1943 to crack down on homosexuality. Instead he ordered the police and judiciary to let up on their gay-baiting. In addition, Perón promoted the tango, legalized prostitution, granted women's suffrage, recognized divorce, and suppressed former discrimination between first-born and later children.[PARAGRAPH:1]After a military coup, Peron went into exile in Paraguay. Later he lived in Panama, where he met nightclub bolero singer Maria Estela Martinez. Eventually settling in Madrid, Spain, he married Maria Estela Martinez, better known as Isabel, in 1961. Peronism was banned and Peronists were persecuted. Peron's third presidency was marked by an escalating conflict between his left and his right-wing supporters. This turmoil was fueled primarily by Peron's growing ties with former rival Ricardo Balbin, the conservative leader of the Radical Party (UCR); whom the Raul Alfonsin led opposition considered a right-wing radical.</string>

He was the leader of the Government Junta of Chile from 1973 to 1974 and President of Chile from 1974 until the return of democratic rule in 1990. From the beginning, the military government led by Pinochet implemented harsh measures against its political opponents, which included systematic suspensions of civil liberties and violations of human rights and for which he faced several criminal indictments beginning in 1998 until his death in 2006. At the time of his death he had not been convicted of any crimes, although investigations were ongoing.[PARAGRAPH:1]The military government also implemented economic reforms, including the privatization of several state controlled industries and the rollback of many state welfare institutions. These policies were initially very successful in recovering economic growth, and are often called el milagro económico (\"the economic miracle\") of the military regime in Chile, but they dramatically increased inequality and some attribute the devastating effect of the 1982 monetary crisis in the Chilean economy to these policies.[PARAGRAPH:1]On September 11, 1973, Pinochet, who twenty days before had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army by socialist President Salvador Allende, led a coup d'état which put an end to Allende's government, and, along with the Navy, Air Force and Carabineros (a national police force), established a military dictatorship. With active support from the CIA Pinochet implemented a series of military operations in which (according to the 1993 Rettig Report) over 3,200 people were killed, while (according to the 2004 Valech Report) at least 80,000 were incarcerated without trials and 30,000 subjected to torture. Another 200,000 people went into exile, particularly in Argentina and Peru, and applied as political refugees; however, some key individuals were followed in their exile by the DINA secret police, in the framework of Operation Condor which linked South American dictatorships together against political opponents.[PARAGRAPH:1]In December 1974, the junta appointed Pinochet as President by a joint decree, to which Air Force General Gustavo Leigh disagreed. The legality of such appointment was confirmed through a highly controversial plebiscite in 1980, which approved a new Constitution drafted by a government-appointed commission. Pinochet remained in power until 1990, after his attempt to stay in power was defeated in the 1988 plebiscite. After stepping down, he continued to serve as Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army until March 10, 1998, when he retired and became a senator-for-life in accordance with the 1980 Constitution.[PARAGRAPH:1]At the time of his death in December 2006, around 300 criminal charges were still pending against him in Chile for human rights abuses (torture, forced disappearance, assassination, etc.), tax evasion and embezzlement under his rule and afterwards in 2006, Pinochet's total wealth was estimated to be at least US$28 million.</string>

Tefnakht of Sais, in reaction against the increasing Kushite pressure in Upper Egypt, formed an alliance between the local kings of the Delta Region and lured King Nimlot of Hermopolis, Piye's apparent ally, into defecting to his side.  Tefnakht then sent his union's army south and besieged Herakleopolis, where its king appealed to Piye for help.  Piye assembled an army to invade Middle and Lower Egypt. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Piye marched north and achieved complete victory at Herakleopolis, conquering the cities of Hermopolis, Memphis, and others.  He also received the submission of several kings of the Nile Delta.  Tefnakht took refuge in an island in the Delta and accepted defeat in a letter to Piye, though refused to pay homage to the Kushite king.  Satisfied with these successes, Piye sailed to his homeland in Nubia.  Despite Piye's success, his authority only extended north of Thebes to the western desert oasis and Herakleopolis.  Therefore, the local kings of Lower Egypt, especially Tefnakht, were free to do as they pleased without Piye's oversight.

Historians disagree about Pontiac's importance in the war that bears his name. Nineteenth century accounts portrayed him as the mastermind and leader of the revolt, while some subsequent interpretations have depicted him as a local leader with limited overall influence.The war began in May 1763 when Pontiac and 300 followers attempted to take Fort Detroit by surprise. His plan foiled, Pontiac laid siege to the fort, and was eventually joined by more than 900 warriors from a half-dozen tribes. Meanwhile, messengers spread the word of Pontiac's actions, and the war expanded far beyond Detroit. In July 1763, Pontiac defeated a British detachment at the Battle of Bloody Run, but he was unable to capture the fort. In October he lifted the siege and withdrew to the Illinois country.Although Pontiac's influence had declined around Detroit because of the unsuccessful siege, he gained stature in the Illinois and Wabash country as he continued to encourage resistance to the British. Seeking to end the war, British officials made Pontiac the focus of their diplomatic efforts. In July 1766, Pontiac made peace with British Superintendent of Indian Affairs Sir William Johnson. The attention which the British paid to Pontiac created resentment among other Indian leaders, particularly because Pontiac claimed far greater authority than he actually possessed. Increasingly ostracized, in 1769 he was assassinated by a Peoria Indian.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_POPAY_PEDIA">[H1]Po'pay[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leader of the Pueblo Revolt[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c. 1630 - 1688 AD[NEWLINE] [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Spanish rule of the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande valley of New Mexico  began in 1598. Although they numbered 40,000 to 80,000 people at that time, the many independent towns, often speaking different languages and hostile to each other were unable to unite in opposition to the Spanish.   Revolts against Spanish rule were frequent, but the Spanish ruthlessly repressed dissent. The Pueblos found themselves at the mercy of Spanish overlords, soldiers, priests, and their Mexican Indian allies, many from Tlaxcala, Mexico. In particular, the Spanish suppressed the religious ceremonies of the Pueblo. Violence, forced labor, and European diseases reduced the Pueblo population to about 15,000 by the latter years of the 17th century.  Po'pay appears in history in 1675 as one of 47 religious leaders of the northern Pueblos arrested by the Spanish for \"witchcraft.\" Three of them were executed, one committed suicide, and the others were whipped, imprisoned in Santa Fe, and sentenced to be sold into slavery. Seventy Pueblo warriors showed up at the governor's office and demanded, politely but persistently, that Po'pay and the others be released. The governor complied, probably in part because the colony was being seriously harassed by Apaches and Navajo and he could not afford to risk a Pueblo revolt.  Popay was described as a fierce and dynamic individualwho inspired respect bordering on fear in those who dealt with him.  After his release, Po'pay retired to the remote Taos Pueblo and began planning a rebellion.  Po'pay's message was simple: destroy the Spanish and their influence and go back to the old ways of life that had given the Pueblos relative peace, prosperity, and independence. The Pueblo revolt displayed \"all the classic characteristics of a revitalization movement....the emergence of a charismatic leader, the development of a core group of followers who spread the prophet's message to the wider public; and, ultimately the successful transformation of Pueblo cultures and communities.\"  Po'pay began secret negotiations with leaders from all other pueblos. They agreed to begin the revolt on August 13, 1680 and runners were sent out to each Pueblo with knotted cords, the number of knots corresponding to the days left before the revolt was to begin.  The revolt actually began before that. The measure of the Pueblo's hatred of the Spanish is indicated that he was able to keep the plans secret, even though they involved many different leaders and towns. Po'pay murdered his own son-in-law, Nicolas Bua, because he feared he might betray the plot to the Spanish. Only the Tiguex area, close to the seat of Spanish power in Santa Fe and perhaps the most acculturated of the Pueblos declined to join in the revolt. The Southern Piros were apparently not invited to join the revolt.The last few years had been relatively quiet and free from internal dissent and the Spanish in the capital city of Santa Fe were astonished as a report came to the governor early in the morning of August 10 that a Spanish priest had been killed at a Pueblo only nine miles from Santa Fe.  By August 15, 1,000 Spaniards had taken refuge in the Governor's palace in Santa Fe and they were besieged by an Indian army led by Po'pay they estimated (or overestimated) to number 2,500. Other Spanish survivors had taken refuge in the friendly Pueblo of Isleta from where they fled south toward Mexico.  On August 21 the Spanish broke out of the Palace and began a long trek south, leaving New Mexico behind and not stopping until they reached El Paso, Texas. The Pueblos did not molest the departing colonists. The survivors numbered nearly 2,000 persons. The revolt cost 400 Spanish lives, including 21 of the 33 priests in New Mexico.Po'pay had succeeded in expelling the Spanish from New Mexico and according to later accounts, possibly prejudiced, set himself up as the sole ruler of all the Pueblos. He attempted to destroy every trace of the Spanish presence in New Mexico. The God of the Christians in dead, he proclaimed. He was made of rotten wood.  A Spanish force of 300 men attempted to regain a foothold in New Mexico in 1681, but was repelled by Popays army. Another Spanish effort in 1687 also failed. But the expulsion of the Spanish had not brought peace and prosperity to the Pueblos. A return to the traditional religion did not bring rain to ease a drought that destroyed crops. The Apaches and Navajo stepped up their raids on the Pueblos and the Indians recalled that the Spaniards had provided some protection from the raiders. Centrifugal forces and traditional rivalries divided the Pueblo villages. Popays efforts to rule over all the Pueblos were resented and he was considered a tyrant by many Pueblos. Moreover, among the Pueblos were sincere Christians with ties of family and friendship with the Spanish. Opposition to Spanish rule had given the Pueblos the incentive to unite, but not the means to remain united once their common enemy was vanquished.  Po'pay died, probably in 1688, with the united Pueblo state he envisioned divided and weak. In 1692, Governor Diego de Vargas, with an army of 150 Spanish soldiers and pro-Spanish Pueblo warriors, attempted reconquest. Vargas wisely promised pardon rather than punishment and most of the Pueblos gradually acceded to Spanish rule although violent opposition continued to Spanish rule for several years. Only the Hopi, living in distant Arizona retained their independence although many Pueblos also took up residence among the Navajo and Apaches.</string>

Immediately, at the age of 17, he had to set out to put down rebellions to secure his position. As a shrewd diplomat he played off competing British and French interests. The French were weakened by losing Réunion and Mauritius to the British in 1810. The British were interested to secure the passage to India and to prevent the French from taking Madagascar. Having not enough resources to possess Madagascar themselves, the British made an alliance with Radama and supported him. Their Governor Robert Townsend Farquhar  from Mauritius committed to training and supporting his army. The Anglo-Merina treaty of friendship was sealed by a blood oath between Radama and the British envoy Captain Le Sage in 1817. As part of the treaty Radama agreed to put an end to the profitable slave trade, nevertheless slave-dealing continued clandestinely at a reduced level. Thomas Pye and James Hastie were the British representatives at the capital in Antananarivo.As a result of the treaty social and political changes occurred; Radama organized a cabinet, and invited the Protestant London Missionary Society to establish schools and churches. The Society also brought a printing press and adapted the latin alphabet for the Malagasy language, replacing the arabico-malagasy script previously in use. The missionaries set up craft industries in wood, metal, leather, and cotton.

During this time and with the help of the British support, Radamas military became the dominant force allowing him to unify by force the island. Expanding the boundaries of the kingdom, he first took over the area of the Betsileo tribe in the southern part of the island. The next step was the submission of the Sakalava  on the west coast. The people on the east coast did not put up a major fight when he arrived with an army of 35,000 men being aware of his ruthless methods.  With the unification accomplished he titled himself King of Madagascar, - a step that was protested by the French in 1823 who had an interest to incorporate the island into their possessions. In response, in 1825 he conquered the French stronghold of Fort Dauphin at the southern end of the island making him the undisputed ruler of Madagascar.His early death in 1828 was caused by illness or overindulgence.  In the assessment of Arthur Stratton, \"Radama was a conqueror. He was a drunkard. Andrianampoinimerina, the Prince Worthy of the Highland People Under the Sun, made his son into an alcoholic and, in effect, cut the young man's throat.\"  Radama had twelve Great Wives, one of them his adopted sister Ranavalona who would emerge victorious in the scheming struggle for succession to become the infamous Queen Ranavalona I.</string>

Shortly after, there was a rebellion against Singhasari in the country of Jayakatwang. Kertanagara was killed in the attempt to put down the rebellion in 1292, and Raden Wijaya fled to Sumenap, Madura, along with the governor of that region, Aria Wiraraja. There, Raden Wijaya made a plan to establish a new kingdom. Wijaya promised that he would divide Java with Aria Wiraraja if Aria Wiraraja could help him overthrow Jayakatwang's Kediri kingdom.  Wiraraja's son Ranggalawe served as one of Wijaya's senapati (warlord) but in later days he would rebel against the new king. Other famous officers were Lembu Sora and Nambi, both also rebelled against Wijaya respectively after the founding of Majapahit kingdom.  In November 1292, a Mongol force landed in Tuban, East Java, with the aim of revenge for Kertanagara's humiliation of the Mongol messenger. However, Kertanegara was already dead. Raden Wijaya made an alliance with the Mongols with the aim of attacking Singhasari, which by this time had fallen under the power of Jayakatwang. Jayakatwang was defeated and destroyed in 1293, at which point Raden Wijaya attacked the Mongol force. The Mongols, already weakened by tropical diseases, the climate, and imperial overreach, were forced to flee Java.  Raden Wijaya then established the Majapahit kingdom, taking the title Kertarajasa Jayawardhana, and establishing his palace in the area of Trowulan, which is now in Kabupaten Mojokerto, East Java.Raden Wijaya was known as a firm and capable ruler. Aria Wiraraja who had been so useful during the period of the establishment of the kingdom, was given Madura, which was granted a special status.

Rajendra formally ascended the Chola throne in 1014 CE, two years after his installation as the Co Regent. He placed a son on the throne at Madurai, completed the conquest of Ceylon, overran the Deccan (c. 1021), and sent (1023) an expedition to the north that penetrated to the Ganges River and brought Ganges water to the new capital, Gangaikondacolapuram.[PARAGRAPH:2]Before the fourteenth year of Rajendras reign c. 1025, the Chola Navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman. Kadaram, the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom, was sacked and the king taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present day Sumatra and Malaiyur in the Malayan peninsula were attacked. Kedah (now in modern Malaysia) too was occupied. There are no records to explain the nature of and the reason for this naval expedition. The Sailendra dynasty had been in good relations with the Chola Empire during the period of Rajaraja Chola I. Rajaraja encouraged Mara Vijayatungavarman to build the Chudamani Vihara at Nagapattinam. Rajendra confirmed this grant in the Anaimangalam grants showing that the relationship with Srivijaya was still continued be friendly. The exact cause of the quarrel that caused the naval war between Cholas and Srivijaya remains unknown.[PARAGRAPH:2]Rajendras long reign saw almost continuous campaigns and conflicts trying to hold his huge empire together. Rajendras sons carried out most of the campaigns during the late period of his reign. The emperor refrained from taking the field personally allowing his sons to win glory and distinction. The closing years of Rajendra forms the most splendid period of Cholas. The extent of the empire was the widest and the military and naval prestige was at its highest. The emperor was ably assisted by his sons and other members of his family. The Chola imperialism was a benevolent one attested by the presence of the traditional rulers in the Pandya and Kerala countries and the act of reinstating the Srivijaya king after his defeat.</string>

Very little evidence has been found of a king in the Indus Valley, only one white priest-king idol and a silver crown; not enough to establish that the \"royalty\" were the rulers. Instead the empire was likely divided into regions with half a dozen cities functioning as capitals and was governed by a group of people. Archeologists have speculated that the Harappan rulers were merchants, ritual specialists and individuals controlling important resources, instead of just one social group controlling the rest. From the construction of the cities however it does appear there were some social classes.[PARAGRAPH:1]Others have also questioned the persistent belief that Harappan society was a realm of religious control ruled by a priest king, arguing that while tribal institutions are likely to have survived into the Harappan period, it also appears to have witnessed the emergence of an early state with rulers who would have initiated and cemented relationships between various social groups.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nevertheless, one of the more famous artefacts retrieved from Harappan ruins remains seated male sculpture, or \"Priest King\" from Mohenjo-daro. This statue has become a symbol for the Indus valley civilization. Archaeologists discovered the sculpture in Lower town at Mohenjo-Daro in 1927. It was found in an unusual house with ornamental brickwork and a wall niche and was lying between brick foundation walls which once held up a floor.[PARAGRAPH:1]This bearded sculpture wears a fillet around the head, an armband, and a cloak decorated with trefoil patterns that were originally filled with red pigment. The two ends of the fillet fall along the back and though the hair is carefully combed towards the back of the head, no bun is present. The flat back of the head may have held a separately carved bun as is traditional on the other seated figures, or it could have held a more elaborate horn and plumed headdress.[PARAGRAPH:1]The \"Priest King\" statue was found at Mohenjo-daro in the 1920s and the gold and steatite eyebead apparently worn on the forehead of the \"Priest King\" was found in Harappa in 1995. \"Rishi\" is a term meaning \"teacher\", and has been preferred by some archaeologists when referring to the figure.</string>

According to legend, Robert's mother kept his father captive until he agreed to marriage.  Little is known about his youth, although it is possible he was sent to be fostered with a local family, which was a custom in those times.  Bruce was most likely raised speaking the languages Gaelic, Norman French, and Latin.  It is also believed that he knew English.  Robert saw the events of the 'Great Cause' unjust, in which the Crown of Scotland was given to his distant relative, John Balliol.  Robert thought it prevented his branch of the family from their accession to the throne of Scotland.  Soon later, Robert's grandfather resigned lordship to Robert's father.  Thus, Robert the Bruce was the Earl of Carrick.  Both Robert and his father sided with King Edward I of England against Balliol.  In 1295, Robert married his first wife, Isabella of Mar.  Some sources claim that there is lineage between Isabella and King John of England.  [PARAGRAPH: 1] In August of 1296, Bruce and his father swore allegiance to Edward I of England.  In the following year, Bruce joined the Scottish revolt against King Edward.  Letters were sent to Robert urging him to support the English.  He responded by laying waste to the lands owned by Edward.  Bruce eventually made terms with a treaty and he was pardoned in return for swearing loyalty to King Edward.  After William Wallace resigned as Guardian of Scotland after the Battle of Falkirk, Robert the Bruce and John Comyn succeeded him as joint rulers.  The following year, Bruce resigned from his position.  Later, Comyn and his joint ruler, Sir Gilbert, were replaced by Sir John de Soules. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In July, King Edward launched his sixth campaign into Scotland and captured two castles.  Robert the Bruce along with other nobles then submitted to King Edward.  In 1303, Edward invaded again.  John Comyn, who was now the Guardian of Scotland, didn't fight against the King because he had no hope to win.  By 1304, all the leading Scots, except for William Wallace, surrendered to King Edward.  Later that year, Robert made a secret pact with William Lamberton committing to patriotism toward Scotland.  The next year, William Wallace was executed and King Edward took control of Scotland. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In June of 1306, Bruce was defeated at the Battle of Methven and fled to an island of the northern coast of Ireland.  King Edward I marched north the next spring and granted all the Scottish estates of Bruce to his own followers.  On July 7 however, King Edward I died.  Robert the Bruce's only opposition was the new weak ruler, Edward II.  Bruce then returned to Scotland and won a small victory at the Battle of Glen Trool and capturing two castles.  He also burned Inverness Castle and Nairn to the ground.  Bruce continued his successful campaigns throughout the year 1308.  In 1309, he held his first Parliament at St. Andrew and the clergy of Scotland recognized Bruce as King at a general council.  During the next few years, Bruce oversaw the capture and destruction of several English castles.  In May, Bruce raided England and restrained the Isle of Man.  Bruce secured Scottish independence from England through powerful military might at the Battle of Bannockburn. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Now on a military high, Bruce invaded Ireland in 1315, supposedly to free the country from English rule.  Most likely, Bruce wanted to open a second front in the continuing wars with England.  The Irish even crowned Bruce's brother Edward as High King of Ireland in 1316.  The campaigns into Ireland made some successes, but none were significant enough to make any major changes.  With the support of only the Ulster chiefs, victory was unlikely.  Bruce died on June 7, 1329 at the Manor of Cardross in Cardross Parish, Dumbarton.  He suffered some years of disease, and it is sometimes believed that he died of leprosy just as his father did.</string>

He also forced the Roman Empire to give up all the rogue Hunnish soldiers they had acquired over the years. This was a big event, because the Roman Empire had come to rely on all of their Hunnish soldiers. His most important act, though, was that he united the Huns under his sole kingship by 432.

The Egyptian encyclopedist Ahmad al-Qalqashandi (died 1418) also praises Sa'ad ad-Din's victories against the Ethiopians.  Pankhurst adds that Sa'ad ad-Din also fought against the kingdom of the Hadiya and a pastoral people called the Zalan, both of whom were Ethiopian allies.  However, as Taddesse Tamrat notes, these successes were short-lived, and in response to the growing Muslim power in the region Emperor Dawit I strengthened the Ethiopian defenses along the border and established his court at Tilq in Fatagar.  Despite these steps, Sa'ad ad-Din's practice of making quick raids into Ethiopian territory presented a difficult challenge to the Ethiopian Emperor, and it was not until the sultan was pursued deep into Adal territory that the Ethiopians got purchase on the problem. After a battle between Sa'ad ad-Din and the Ethiopian general Barwa, in which the Ifat army was defeated and \"no less than 400 elders, each of whom carried an iron bar as his insignia of office\" were killed, Sa'ad ad-Din with his remaining supporters were chased to Zeila in modern Somalia.  There, the Emperor besieged Zeila, finally capturing the city and killing Sultan Sa'ad ad-Din.  With Sa'ad ad-Din's death, the Walashma dynasty adopted the title of \"kings of Adal\".

She also believed that the young adults should have the freedom to choose their spouses and encouraged parents to refrain from the norm of arranged marriages. Furthermore, she took on the powerful tulafales or talking chiefs and worked hard to curb their power to forcefully persuade a chief to marry many times, which ultimately resulted in the talking chiefs receiving many fine mats and other wealth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Due to Queen Salamasina's benevolence and leadership, the marriages of her chiefs stabilized, her people enjoyed peace, and the arts fluorished.

[PARAGRAPH:1]Born in Argentina, but raised in Spain, by the age of 11, Jose de San Martin was already a member of the Spanish armed forces. In the Peninsular War between Spain and France in 1808, San Martin began as an aide to the Spanish leadership; by war's end he had attained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. [PARAGRAPH:1]In the midst of the war, the Spanish king abdicated from power to be replaced by an appointment of the opposing French. The citizens of Argentina, upon hearing of the Spanish government's state of disarray, decided that there would be no better time to declare independence. When news of the Argentine revolution reached him, San Martin elected to support the rebels' cause, leaving Spain for the New World. Upon his arrival, he was immediately recruited by the rebel forces to begin mustering and training an elite regiment. His regiment, known as the Mounted Grenadiers, became some of the finest troops South America had to offer. [PARAGRAPH:1]Once his troops were ready, the normally reserved drillmaster suggested a daring move - marching an army from Argentina to Chile through the peaks of the Andes. His plan was regarded as madness by many, but San Martin managed to muster more than enough brave souls to join him in the endeavor. Dividing his forces into six columns for easier travel through the difficult terrain, San Martin planned for each column to arrive within two days of one another, a highly unlikely prospect given the extreme terrain and great danger that lay ahead. [PARAGRAPH:1]But on February 12, nearly all four thousand troops stepped out from the shadows of the Andes onto the plains of Chacabuco, prepared to face the numerically superior Spanish forces. Despite having just traversed some of the most inhospitable terrain on earth, San Martin's \"Army of the Andes,\" soundly defeated the Royalists. They then marched on the Chilean capital of Santiago, taking the city with little fuss. Despite what many thought to be a crushing loss on the field of Tacla roughly a month later, Chile was to remain in the hands of San Martin and his revolutionary followers. [PARAGRAPH:1]The citizens of Chile attempted to appoint San Martin governor of their colony, but he refused. He had his sights set on the bastion of Spanish power in South America - Lima, Peru. San Martin took his forces north, offering the Spanish forces in Lima the opportunity to surrender and set up a new constitutional government. Their refusal sealed their fate - in 1821, San Martin marched into Lima, taking the city for the rebels. He was soon proclaimed the first President of Peru. [PARAGRAPH:1]Small pockets of Spanish forces remained scattered throughout the Peruvian countryside and in order to ensure their removal, San Martin requested a conference with Simon Bolivar, the Liberator of the north whose military zone of influence overlapped that of San Martin. [PARAGRAPH:1]The two met in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador in 1822. What they discussed is unknown, but the result is - on that day San Martin stepped down from his position, leaving the fate of South America in the hands of Bolivar. San Martin had previously displayed a wavering of passion for his cause, but it took the words of Bolivar to force a decision. Upon stepping down, San Martin settled with his wife and children on a farm in Argentina for two years before migrating to Europe, where he spent the remainder of his days moving from country to country in order to escape the numerous revolutions sweeping the continent at the time. He died in France in 1850.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_SANTA_ANNA_PEDIA">[H1]Antonio de Padua María Severino López de Santa Anna y Pérez de Lebrón [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Mexico (11 times)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD]21 February 1794 - 21 June 1876[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Santa Anna was a Mexican political leader, general and President who greatly influenced early Mexican and Spanish politics and government. He first fought against the independence from Spain, and then supported it. He rose to the ranks of general and president at various times over a turbulent 40-year career. He was President of Mexico on seven non-consecutive occasions over a period of 22 years.[PARAGRAPH:1] Santa Anna's normal loyalty would be to ally with the wealthy and privileged, but his immediate concern was to be on the winning side in any battle. Switching allegiance never troubled him. Santa Anna declared himself retired, \"unless my country needs me\". He decided he was needed when Anastasio Bustamante led a coup, overthrowing and killing President Vicente Guerrero. Santa Anna was elected president in 1833.Gómez Farías did many reforms, introducing antimilitary and anticlergical reforms. He reduced the size of the army and worked hard to root out corruption in the military. He also changed some rules reflecting the power of the Church. Clergymen would be allowed to preach only for religious matters. He altered the education as a fully secular system. The mandatory tax for the support of the Church was abolished. These drastic reforms angered many of the powerful among the military, wealthy landowners, and the Catholic Church. When there was rebellion and violence against the reform that Farias had made, Santa Anna changed his side, again. Santa Anna reversed his support for the liberals and joined the conservatives, dismissed Farías, declared the Constitution suspended, disbanded the Congress, and worked to concentrate power in the central government. This was applauded by some conservatives, but met with considerable disapproval from other sectors. He established a Catholic, centralist dictatorship and replaced the Constitution of 1824(the one that Farias established), with a new document, called The Seven Laws. - the Constitution of 1836. The regime was a centralized dictatorship led by the military.Several states went into open rebellion: Coahuila y Tejas, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro, Durango, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Yucatán, Jalisco, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas and Zacatecas. Several of these states formed their own governments, the Republic of the Rio Grande, the Republic of Yucatan, and the Republic of Texas. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. They and their allies from the United States declared independence from Mexico. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies.The Zacatecan militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by Francisco Garcia, was well armed with .753 caliber British 'Brown Bess' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. After two hours of combat, on 12 May 1835, the Santa Anna's \"Army of Operations\" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to ransack Zacatecas for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_SARGON_PEDIA">[H1]Sargon the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Akkadian Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c.2334 - c.2215 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Sargon of Akkad was one of the earliest of the world's great empire builders, conquering all of southern Mesopotamia as well as parts of Syria, Anatolia, and Elam (western Iran). He established the region's first Semitic dynasty and was considered the founder of the Mesopotamian military tradition.  Sargon is known almost entirely from the legends and tales that followed his reputation through 2,000 years of cuneiform Mesopotamian history, and not from documents that were written during his lifetime. The lack of contemporary record is explained by the fact that the capital city of Agade, which he built, has never been located and excavated. It was destroyed at the end of the dynasty that Sargon founded and was never again inhabited, at least under the name of Agade.  According to a folktale, Sargon was a self-made man of humble origins; a gardener, having found him as a baby floating in a basket on the river, brought him up in his own calling. His father is unknown; his own name during his childhood is also unknown; his mother is said to have been a priestess in a town on the middle Euphrates. Rising, therefore, without the help of influential relations, he attained the post of cupbearer to the ruler of the city of Kish, in the north of the ancient land of Sumer. The event that brought him to supremacy was the defeat of Lugalzaggisi of Uruk (biblical Erech, in central Sumer). Lugalzaggisi had already united the city-states of Sumer by defeating each in turn and claimed to rule the lands not only of the Sumerian city-states but also those as far west as the Mediterranean. Thus, Sargon became king over all of southern Mesopotamia, the first great ruler for whom, rather than Sumerian, the Semitic tongue known as Akkadian was natural from birth, although some earlier kings with Semitic names are recorded in the Sumerian king list. Victory was ensured, however, only by numerous battles, since each city hoped to regain its independence from Lugalzaggisi without submitting to the new overlord. It may have been before these exploits, when he was gathering followers and an army, that Sargon named himself Sharru-kin (\"Rightful King\") in support of an accession not achieved in an old-established city through hereditary succession. Historical records are still so meager, however, that there is a complete gap in information relating to this period.  Not content with dominating this area, his wish to secure favorable trade with Agade throughout the known world, together with an energetic temperament, led Sargon to defeat cities along the middle Euphrates to northern Syria and the silver-rich mountains of southern Anatolia. He also dominated Susa, capital city of the Elamites, in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran, where the only truly contemporary record of his reign has been uncovered. Such was his fame that some merchants in an Anatolian city, probably in central Turkey, begged him to intervene in a local quarrel, and, according to the legend, Sargon, with a band of warriors, made a fabulous journey to the still-unlocated city of Burushanda (Purshahanda), at the end of which little more than his appearance was needed to settle the dispute.  As the result of Sargon's military prowess and ability to organize, as well as of the legacy of the Sumerian city-states that he had inherited by conquest and of previously existing trade of the old Sumerian city-states with other countries, commercial connections flourished with the Indus Valley, the coast of Oman, the islands and shores of the Persian Gulf, the lapis lazuli mines of Badakhshan, the cedars of Lebanon, the silver-rich Taurus Mountains, Cappadocia, Crete, and perhaps even Greece.During Sargon's rule Akkadian became adapted to the script that previously had been used in the Sumerian language, and the new spirit of calligraphy that is visible upon the clay tablets of this dynasty is also clearly seen on contemporary cylinder seals, with their beautifully arranged and executed scenes of mythology and festive life. Even if this new artistic feeling is not necessarily to be attributed directly to the personal influence of Sargon, it shows that, in his new capital, military and economic values were not alone important.  Because contemporary record is lacking, no sequence can be given for the events of his reign. Neither the number of years during which he lived nor the point in time at which he ruled can be fixed exactly; 2334 BC is now given as a date on which to hang the beginning of the dynasty of Agade, and, according to the Sumerian king list, he was king for 56 years.  2334 BC is now given as a date on which to hang the beginning of the dynasty of Agade, and, according to the Sumerian king list, he was king for 56 years.  The latter part of his reign was troubled with rebellions, which later literature ascribes, predictably enough, to sacrilegious acts that he is supposed to have committed; but this can be discounted as the standard cause assigned to all disasters by Sumerians and Akkadians alike. The troubles, in fact, were probably caused by the inability of one man, however energetic, to control so vast an empire without a developed and well-tried administration. There is no evidence to suggest that he was particularly harsh, nor that the Sumerians disliked him for being a Semite. The empire did not collapse totally, for Sargon's successors were able to control their legacy, and later generations thought of him as being perhaps the greatest name in their history.  Attributing his success to the patronage of the goddess Ishtar, in whose honor Agade was erected, Sargon of Akkad became the first great empire builder. Two later Assyrian kings were named in his honor. Although the briefly recorded information of his predecessor Lugalzaggisi shows that expansion beyond the Sumerian homeland had already begun, later Mesopotamians looked to Sargon as the founder of the military tradition that runs through the history of their people.</string>

The two Minoan rulers known by name, Minos of Knossos and Rhadamanthys of Phaistos, were of divine descent (as sons of Zeus). Minos established the first laws (Laws of Minos) on Crete and acted as judge of the living and dead. Renowned for his justice, Rhadamanthys ruled as king of the dead in the Elysion Fields. The Minoan rulers were divine, established a system of law and order, and were known for their social justice - characteristics that find obvious parallels in the pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom. It seems possible therefore that the first Minoan rulers modeled themselves to some extent on their royal Egyptian counterparts.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kronos (c.1715-1675 BC) known by the Romans as Saturn was probably the Cretan king Satur who ruled at Knossos some time between 1725 and 1675 BC according to Linear A inscriptions.

Seleucus was drawn into the league against Antigonus I, and when Antigonus was defeated at Ipsus in 301 BC, Seleucus gained a large part of Asia Minor and all of Syria. Of the Macedonian generals he was the one who tried hardest to set up a kingdom following Alexander's ideas. He founded Greek colonies such as Seleucia and Antioch. He also tried to govern the subject people according to the methods of the Persian Empire. He finally won Asia Minor by defeating Lysimachus in the battle at Corupedion in Lydia in 281, an event that marked the end of the Diadochi.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_SEPE_TIARAJU_PEDIA">[H1]Sepé Tiaraju[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]??? - 1756[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Sepé Tiaraju was an indigenous Guarani leader born in the Jesuit reduction mission of São Luiz Gonzaga and who died on February 7, 1756, in the municipality of São Gabriel, in the present-day state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.  Sepé Tiaraju led the fight against the Portuguese and Spanish colonial powers in the Guerras Guaraníticas (Guarani War) and was killed three days before a massacre that killed around fifteen hundred of his fellow warriors. After two hundred and fifty years of the date of his death he still remains a very influential figure in the popular imagination, considered a saint by some.  This conflict in South America resulted from the land demarcations established by the European powers with the Tratado de Madrid (1750). According to this treaty the Guarani population inhabiting the Jesuit missions in the region had to be evacuated. After one hundred and fifty years living a unique communal life, neither the prospect of returning to the forests nor moving to another place were considered as options by most mission Guaranis. Further treaties such as the San Idelfonso Treaty (1777) and the Badajoz Treaty (1801) still grappled with issues related to this topic.  The Christianized Guarani population residing in the Jesuit missions (called missões or reduções, in Portuguese), that is in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina combined, is estimated to have numbered approximately eighty thousand at the start of the conflict. At that time these so called evangelized Guaranis - as opposed to the many Guaranis living the traditional way and not in the Jesuit missions - raised what is believed to have been the largest herd of cattle in all of Latin America. Therefore, the Europeans' interests in the area extended beyond land appropriations.  Sepé Tiaraju was immortalized in the letters by Brazilian writer Basílio da Gama in the epic poem O Uraguai (1769) and in the poem \"O Lunar de Sepé\", collected by Simões Lopes Neto and published in the beginning of the 20th century. Since then, he has been a character in many major literary works, like \"O tempo e o vento\" [\"The time and the wind\"], by Erico Verissimo. The expression and battle cry \"Esta terra tem dono!\" (or \"This land has owners!\") is attributed to Sepé Tiaraju.</string>

He was born to Barattarna, the previous king of Mitanni.  Barattarna had established control over northern Mesopotamia.  Here, he installed several client kings with Hurrian names in various cities.  It was left however for Shaushtatar to complete the conquest of the region and establish the Mitanni as a world power. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Now freed from the constant threat undergone by Mitanni of the Egyptians, Shaushtatar turned his attention toward Assyria.  He invaded Assyria and sacked and looted its capital, Assur.  He then turned westward across the Euphrates, along the way gathering beneath his sway all the northern Syrian states as he brought his army to the Mediterranean coast.  He was looking to extend Mitanni's power further south, possibly into Palestine.  However, much of southern Syria still lay within the Egyptian sphere of influence, which had long been a threat to Mitanni. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Shaushtatar wished to now increase Mitanni's territory by conquering Palestine, which already had a significant Hurrian population.  The consequence to his actions was, however, a war against Egypt.  Although the Mitanni military successes against Egyptian forces in the region may have been successful, the long term risks were substantial.  Earlier in his reign, when he had invaded Assyria, neither Assyria nor Kassite Babylon posed a serious threat to Mitanni expansion.  The only major state likely to oppose him was Hatti.  However, the Hittite Kingdom had not yet fully regained its former strength, but did once again expand into many Anatolian territories lost to it after Mursili's assassination.  It was only a matter of time before the Hittites once again turned to Mitanni, which would pose a serious threat.  If at that time Mitanni was at war with Egypt, it would be caught in a conflict between two powerful enemies.  However, it would not be Shaushtatar who would confront these problems, but his son, Artatama I, who would negotiate with the pharaoh Amenhotep II over an alliance.</string>

She was born on Wednesday in 1394 to the chief queen Thuddhamaya.   At birth she was given the name Viharadevi, which likely means \"queen of the monastery\". At age 20 she was married to Binnya Bwe (Smin Chesao), Razadarit's nephew and had a son, Binnya Waru and two daughters, Netaka Taw and Netaka Thin. Her husband died when she was just 25.  In 1422, Sawbu's father King Razadarit died. The king's eldest son Binnya Dhammaraza ascended the throne but his younger brothers Binnya Ran and Binnya Kyan rebelled. By the invitation of Binnya Kyan, King Thihathu of Ava  came down with an army. Binnya Dhammaraza pacified his brothers by making Binnya Ran the crown prince as well as giving the governorship of the Irrawaddy delta, and Binnya Kyan the governorship of Martaban. Crown Prince Binnya Ran in a gesture of peace presented his sister Shin Sawbu to Thihathu, who in turn presented a princess of Ava to marry Binnya Ran.  When Shin Sawbu went to Ava, she was 29 years old, a widow and a mother with a son and two daughters. During the time she resided at Ava, she did not have any additional children.  King Thihathu was very fond of her but he died during a military expedition in the north in 1426. Shin Sawbu remained in Ava for four more years. During her residence at Ava, Shin Sawbu became the patron of two Mon monks, Dhammanyana and Pitakahara, who resided at the Ariyadhaza monastery at Sagaing near Ava. In 1430, after seven years of living at Ava, at the age of 36, the queen escaped with the help of her Mon monk preceptors and returned to Pegu accompanied by them.All members of Pegu's male line to the throne having been exhausted, Shin Sawbu ascended the throne as queen in 1453. Two of her brothers, Binnya Dhammayaza and Banya Ran I, and one of her sons, Binnya Waru, had already ruled as kings of Pegu.  In 1457, shortly after ascending the throne, the Buddhist world celebrated the two thousandth anniversary of the Buddha's Paranirvana which in Southeast Asia is dated to the year 543 B.C.  After ruling Pegu for around seven years, in 1460 she decided to abdicate and move from Pegu to Dagon where she could lead a life of religious devotion next to the Shwedagon pagoda.  Shin Sawbu chose a monk to succeed her on the throne of Pegu. The monk Pitakahara, who had helped her escape from Ava, left the sangha, was given the titles Punnaraja and Dhammazedi, and became her son-in-law and a suitable heir to the throne by marrying her younger daughter Mipakathin.Shin Sawbu lived in Dagon next to the Shwedagon Pagoda until the end of her life in 1470 or 1472.  Even after she moved to Dagon she is said to have still worn a crown.  The actually handing over of power from Shin Sawbu to Dhammazedi, who became king under the title Ramadhipati in the year 1457, is commemorated in an inscription written in the Mon language.  In Dagon, the queen devoted her time and attention to the Shwedagon pagoda, enlarging the platform around the pagoda, paving it with stones and placing stone posts and lamps around the outside of the pagoda. She extended the glebe lands supporting the pagoda to Danok.  Almost everything that Shin Sawbu did, she did in multiples of four:  \"There were four white umbrellas, four golden alms-bowls, four earthenware vessels, and four offerings were made each day. There were twenty-seven men who prepared the lamps each day. There were twenty men as guardians of the pagoda treasury. There were four goldsmith's shops, four orchestras, four drums, four sheds, eight doorkeepers, four sweepers, and twenty lamp lighters. She built round and strengthened the sevenfold wall. Between the walls Her Majesty Banya Thau had them plant palmyra and coconut trees.\"  She also had her own weight in gold (25 viss) beaten out into gold leaf and covered the Shwedagon pagoda with this gold leaf. The inhabitants of Dagon donated 5,000 viss of bronze to the pagoda.</string>

The Puranas tell us that he placed his son at Varanasi and himself ruled from Girivraja (Rajagriha).  Initially, his capital was Rajagriha and Vaishali  was his second royal residence. Later he shifted his capital to Vaishali. His most significant achievement was the destruction of the 'glory' of the Pradyota dynasty of the Avanti  kingdom.

Simeon was born to a Christianized Bulgaria due to his father's reign.  In his early years, Simeon learned the Greek language and received a theological education in Constantinople.  Although Simeon's brother Vladimir was the designated heir of Boris, he was deposed after attempting to reintroduce paganism to Bulgaria and Simeon became king. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Under the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI, the Bulgarian marketplace was moved from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where the Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed.  The merchants then required protection from Simeon, who invaded the Byzantine Empire in 894.  However, the Bulgarian army was required back in the country after a Magyar invasion from the north.  Later, the Magyars were convinced by the Byzantines to attack Bulgaria.  Simeon, being unaware of this agreement, met another force of Byzantines from Italy.  After agreeing to peace with the Byzantine commander, Simeon blocked off the Byzantine navy's route into the Danube.  Simeon, after hearing of the Magyar attack, moved to confront them.  The Magyars defeated Bulgaria and later pillaged its land, and Simeon agreed to peace with Byzantium in 895. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Now that the Byzantine threat was abolished, Simeon planned a campaign against the Magyars.  Simeon defeated the Magyars and expanded Bulgarian territory.  Simeon then defeated a Byzantine army after a dispute about Bulgarian prisoners in Thrace.  The war ended and Byzantium was required to pay an annual tribute and cede lands to Bulgaria.  However, Simeon often violated these treaties, conquering and attacking Byzantine territory on several occasions. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Leo VI's death paved the way for another Bulgarian invasion of Byzantium.  Simeon was recognized as Emperor of the Bulgarians after negotiations with the Byzantines.  In 917, the Byzantines planned a campaign against eh Bulgarians.  In the Battle of Anchialos, one of the largest medieval battles in history, Simeon defeated the Byzantines.  In order to cease Serbian unrest, Simeon removed the current Serbian ruler and replaced him with another, ensuring Bulgarian influence over Serbia. [PARAGRAPH: 1] After another government change in Constantinople, Simeon declared war on Byzantium to further assert his power.  He captured several Byzantine cities and requested the help of the Arabs.  However, the Arabs accepted peace with the Byzantines, thus ruining their alliance with Bulgaria.  Simeon was forced to establish peace with Byzantium after the threat of a Serbian uprising, where he deposed the Serbian ruler.  In 926, Simeon's troops invaded Croatia, but were defeated by the army of King Tomislav.  In the last years of his life, Simeon prepared for another siege of Constantinople.  On May 27, 927, Simeon died of heart failure in his palace in Preslav and was succeeded by his son Peter I.</string>

He was the son of a king and the father of a king, but the relation of his dynasty to the previous one is disputed. His realm included the lower reaches of the Borysthenes and Hypanis, as well as the northern part of Crimea, where his capital, Scythian Neapolis, was situated.  Skilurus ruled over the Tauri and controlled the ancient trade emporium of Pontic Olbia, where he minted coins. In order to gain advantage against Chersonesos, he allied himself with the Sarmatian tribe of Rhoxolani. In response, Chersonesos forged an alliance with Mithridates VI of Pontus. Skilurus died during a war against Mithridates, a decisive conflict for supremacy in the Pontic steppe. Soon after his death, the Scythians were defeated by Mithridates (ca. 108 BC). Either Skilurus or his son and successor Palacus were buried in a mausoleum at Scythian Neapolis; it was used from ca. 100 BC to ca. 100 AD.  Plutarch, in Sayings of Kings and Commanders, reports the following anecdote: \"Scilurus on his death-bed, being about to leave eighty sons surviving, offered a bundle of darts to each of them, and bade them break them. When all refused, drawing out one by one, he easily broke them; thus teaching them that, if they held together, they would continue strong, but if they fell out and were divided, they would become weak.\"</string>

In 1674, Sobieski called for war against the Turks and managed to capture several fortresses, now establishing a strong southern border for Poland in the Ukraine.  In 1675, the Tatars attempted to retake the strategic town of Zorawno, but were unsuccessful.  Thus, a peace treaty was signed soon after.  With the signing of peace treaties, focus was turned from war to the reparation of the country and strengthening the royal authority.  Although constantly stressed with Austria and Brandenburg, Sobieski reformed the Polish military.  The military was reorganized, infantry's pikes replaced with battle-axes, and Polish cavalry adopting the formations of hussars and dragoons.  Sobieski also increased the number of guns and developed new tactics for artillery. [PARAGRAPH: 1] At this time, Sobieski made several attempts to strengthen Poland against its enemies.  In the end, he decided to ally himself with Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor.  He also joined the Holy League initiated by Pope Innocent XI to preserve Christendom.  The alliance, although aimed against the Turks, had the advantage of gaining support for the defense of Poland's southern borders.  After Polish spies uncovered Turkish preparations for a military campaign, Sobieski fortified the cities of Lwow and Krakow, which he feared were the targets of the Turkish campaigns. [PARAGRAPH: 1] One of Sobieski's greatest successes was in the victory at the Battle of Vienna, in joined command of Polish, Austrian, and German troops.  Together, they fought the invading Turks under Kara Mustafa.  He led a full attack of 81,000 men against 130,000 Turks which were divided between the attacking of the town and fighting of the united army.  Sobieski later led four hussar cavalry groups into a charge down the hillside.  Soon, the Turkish battle line was broken and the Battle of Vienna ended. [PARAGRAPH: 1] King John III Sobieski died in Wilanow, Poland on June 17, 1696.  He and his wife, who died in 1716 in France, are buried together in Wawel Cathedral in Krakow, Poland.  He was succeeded by Augustus II, whose death lead to a struggle for the crown of Poland, known as the War of the Polish Succession.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_SOLOMON_PEDIA">[H1]Solomon[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Israel[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c.1000 - 928 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]The time of the reigns of David and Solomon was a golden age for Israel.  David's military skill relieved Israel of its constant war threats from surrounding nations, and Solomon's diplomatic skill maintained this empire without the need for further war.  Solomon was productive in art and science.  He wrote the Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, and most of the Book of Proverbs, three books found in the Bible.  Early in Solomon's reign, God promised him great wisdom. [PARAGRAPH:1] When King David was aging, he lost his mental sharpness.  His oldest son, Adonijah, attempted to seize the throne from Solomon.  Despite the fact that God had promised Solomon the throne, David, in his declining mental health, did nothing to stop Adonijah and his preparations.  Eventually, the case was brought to the attention of David by Solomon's supporters.  David immediately made Solomon king, and retired.  Normally, Solomon would kill Adonijah.  However, in an attempt to spare his life, Adonijah stole the altar of God and refused to give it back until Solomon promised to spare his life. [PARAGRAPH:1] Solomon is described as surrounding himself with luxuries because of the government's success.  Solomon established an alliance with Hiram I, king of Tyre, who helped to give Solomon the supplies he needed for the construction of the Temple.  Hiram, and an architect also named Hiram, also helped Solomon complete the construction of the Ark of the Covenant. [PARAGRAPH:1] Solomon built many houses, palaces, gardens, parks, irrigations, and public works.  The most famous of his achievements is his construction of the Temple.  Because David was unable to build the temple, he accumulated materials for future use.  Solomon imported more supplies later.  The amount was so great that, to transport the materials, Solomon conscripted a labor force of nearly 200,000 of his own people, not counting the workers of the foreign exporters.  Solomon preached sermons and worshipped at the temple.  He also prayed to God to be present at the temple.  God spoke to Solomon again, and said that if his people were unfaithful, he would destroy them.  Even so, if they confessed and repented, he would bless them again. [PARAGRAPH:1] After the completion of the temple, Solomon built many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem.  For thirteen years, he was engaged in building the royal palace on Ophel.  Solomon is also described to rebuild major cities elsewhere in Israel.  Solomon is also attributed to supplying Israel with chariots and horsemen.  Solomon's reign in Israel also resulted in great trade and riches with other countries.  Solomon's fame spread to wide that it reached the Queen of Sheba, who immediately went to Jerusalem with a caravan full of gifts.  Once she arrived, she was very impressed at his immense wealth. [PARAGRAPH:1] Though Solomon remained devout to God for most of his early life, his late was different.  Solomon married 1,000 wives, some of which were foreign.  God forbade this for fear their religious practices would corrupt the true worship of God.  This is in fact what happened to Solomon.  Solomon, out of love for his wives, builds idols for them.  Building idols was a very bad sin in the eyes of God.  Because Solomon went against God's laws, he cursed Solomon's heir, Rehoboam who lost most of the kingdom.</string>

Tibetan records from the twelfth century generally write that Songtsen Gampo ascended the throne at age thirteen and ruled until his death. During Songtsen's father's reign, he brought new cultural ties to the east, during which Chinese traditions of medicine and divination were first introduced into Tibet.  The government of Namri Löntsen sent two embassies to China in 608 and 609, marking the first appearance of Tibet on the international scene.   Löntsen also expanded the Pugyel Dynasty's territory during his reign.  Following the assignation of Longtsen, the young Songtsen Gampo and his ministers quickly made plans to retake control of the parts of the country lost during Namri Löntsen's last years.  [PARAGRAPH: 1] Songtsen Gampo's government at the time did not want to engage in warfare in order to conquer the revolting territories and new territories due to the high cost of war.  Thus, they instead used diplomacy whenever possible to obtain territorial gains.  It was in this way that Songtsen Gampo was able to expand his Tibetan Empire and use his new subjects as allies.  At its height, the Tibetan Empire ranged from the plains of India and the mountains of Nepal to the frontiers of China.  However, peaceful diplomacy and incentives were not the only way Songtsen Gampo expanded the Tibetan Empire, warfare was also used.  Songtsen's family ties to the kingdom of Zhangzhung in western Tibet allowed its conquering to be a success.  It was achieved through harsh warfare wherein Songtsen's armies slaughtered the Zhangzhung king and annihilated his fortresses. [PARAGRAPH: 1] The defeat of Limigya marked the end of the Bon center of religion in Zhangzhung and also marked the first time the Tibetan plateau was subject to a unified rule.  With this unity came a large amount of resources and manpower more readily available than in earlier years.  This new kingdom allowed for Songtsen Gampo to achieve territorial gains in the following years.  According to Tibetan Annals, Songtsen Gampo died in 649.  His tomb is in the Chongyas Valley near Yalung.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_STAMBOLOV_PEDIA">[H1]Stefan Stambolov[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Bulgarian revolutionary and Statesman[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]January 31, 1854 - July 6, 1895 AD[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Stefan Nikolov Stambolov was a Bulgarian revolutionary and statesman. He is considered as one of the most important and popular \"Founders of Modern Bulgaria\" and is sometimes referred to as \"the Bulgarian Bismarck\".[PARAGRAPH:2]He was born in Veliko Turnovo. His education started in his home town, but he later studied in the Odessa Seminary between 1870 and 1872. Stambolov's father took part in the \"Velchova Zavera\" (1835) works with Captain Nikola Filipovski (1853). Stambolov himself grew up among revolutionists like Hristo Ivanov \"Knigovezetza\", father Mathei Preobrazhenski - Mitkaloto, Hristo Karaminkov \"Buneto\". He took part in all actions for political independence in the 1870s - he joined the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC). After the death of the founder of BRCC Vassil Levski, Stambolov was chosen as his successor. He was the leader of the unsuccessful uprising in Stara Zagora (1875) and the Turnovo revolutionary committee in the great uprising of April (1876).[PARAGRAPH:2]Stambolov was involved in the political discussions as early as the time of the first Bulgarian parliament - \"The Founding Assembly\" of 1879. After 1880 he became the vice-chairman and later the chairman of the Narodno Subranie (the Bulgarian parliament). For a relatively long period he was the Prime Minister of the country (1887 - 1894). He helped the Union of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia (1885). In 1886, when pro-Russian officers staged a coup d'etat against the Bulgarian prince Alexander von Battenberg, Stambolov directed the successful counter coup d'etat. The prince, however, could not remain on the throne without the approval of the Russian emperor Alexander III and had to leave the country. Stambolov was a nationalist; as a politician, he strengthened the diplomacy of the country, its economy, and the general political power of the state. He crushed Russia's numerous attempts to overthrow the Bulgarian government and install a puppet regime. He confronted Ferdinand's intrigues (after Ferdinand succeeded Alexander Batenberg) and, as a result, he was attacked and slayed by his political enemies, led by Ferdinand in Sofia on July 3, 1895. He died three days later.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Regency[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Stefan Stambolov was twice called upon to occupy the Bulgarian throne as chief regent during two periods in its precarious history. The first was during the self-imposed exile of Prince Alexander Battenberg between 28 August 1886 and 3 September 1886 and, subsequently, during the vacancy of the throne between 7 September 1886 and 14 August 1887 following Alexander's eventual abdication.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the age of 32, Stambolov found himself in the highly-unusual position of being a minister of government, president and prince regent (a situation matched in its unusualness only, perhaps, by the election of former King II Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the office of prime minister of Bulgaria in 2001, making him one of the few monarchs in history who regained political power through democratic election to a different office). Stambolov's style of governing during the period of his regency was observed as being increasingly authoritarian and dictatorial but, this was, to some extent, a reaction to the various threats and dangers which attached to the reality of occupying each of these positions concurrently. Indeed, the regency has been described as marking the beginning of the tragic years of Stambolov's life.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to a close friend, Stambolov was \"almost inclined to resign the honours [of serving as regent], together with the dangers of his position, and retire to his beloved Turnovo\" but stayed on recognizing that if he did not lead, then, in the absence of any other willing or able candidates, Bulgaria's sovereignty would likely be lost.[PARAGRAPH:2]Through Stambolov's efforts, a successor to the troubled reign of Alexander was found in Ferdinand, Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who was proclaimed Prince Regent of autonomous Bulgaria on 7 July 1887 and crowned on 14 August 1887.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Assessment[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Stambolov was the only Bulgarian politician to realize that the so-called liberation of Bulgaria was an attempt by Czarist Russia to turn Bulgaria into its protectorate. His policy was to preserve Bulgarian independence from Russian aggression. The times of his leadership were characterized by the transformation of Bulgaria from an Ottoman province into a modern European state.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stambolov took into account the need to inflame Bulgarian nationalism in Macedonia (then still under Ottoman control) to further this objective. Stambolov established close connections with the Sultan in order to enliven Bulgarian national spirit in Macedonia and to demonstrate Bulgaria's opposition to Russian-backed Greek and Serbian propaganda. Due to Stambolov's tactics, the Sultan recognized Bulgarians as the predominant peoples in Macedonia and gave a green light to the creation of strong church and cultural institutions.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stambolov negotiated loans with Western European countries in order to develop the military strength of Bulgaria. In part, this was motivatied by his desire to create a modern army which could successfully unify the nation with the support of the Bulgarian national uprising in Macedonia.[PARAGRAPH:2]His approach toward Western Europe was one of diplomatic maneuvering. He understood the interests of the Austrian empire in Macedonia and warned his diplomats accordingly. His domestic policy was distinguished by the defeat of terrorist groups sponsored by Russia, the strengthening of the rule of law, as well as by measures taken to promote rapid economic and social change, and to develop a modern army capable of protecting Bulgaria's indipendnce.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stambolov realized that only a politically, militarily and economically strong Bulgaria could ensure national unification. Stambolov mapped out the political course which turned Bulgaria into a strong regional power.</string>

The date of this coronation is variously given as Christmas Day, 1000 or 1 January 1001.[PARAGRAPH:1]After (or just before) his coronation Stephen I founded several dioceses.He also established the Archdiocese of Esztergom, thus he set up an ecclesiastical organisation independent of the German archbishops. He also began to organise a territory-based administration by founding several counties (comitatus, megye) in his kingdom. Stephen discouraged pagan customs and strengthened Christianity with various laws. In his first decree, issued in the beginning of his rule, he ordered that each ten villages are obliged to build a church. He invited foreign priests to Hungary to evangelize his kingdom; Saint Astricus served as his advisor, and Stephen also had Saint Gerard Sagredo as the tutor for his son Imre.[PARAGRAPH:1]In his external politics Stephen I allied himself with his brother-in-law, the Emperor Henry II against Prince Boleslaw I of Poland, who had extended his rule over the territories between the Morava and Vág Rivers. He sent troops to the Emperor's army, and in the Peace of Bautzen, in 1018, the Polish prince had to hand over the occupied territories to Stephen. After the death of Henry II (July 3, 1024), Stephen broke with the German alliance, because the new Holy Roman Emperor, Conrad II claimed the supremacy over the kingdom of Hungary, while Stephen demanded the duchy of Bavaria for his son Emeric who was the nearest relative of the deceased Emperor Henry II (who himself had been the last male descendant of the old dukes of Bavaria). In 1027, Stephen had Bishop Werner of Strasbourg, the envoy sent by Conrad II to the Byzantine Empire, arrested at the frontier. In 1030, the Emperor lead his armies against Hungary, but Stephen's troops enforced their retreat. Stephen and the Emperor Conrad II concluded peace in 1031, and the territories between the Leitha (Hungarian:(Lajta)) and Fischa Rivers were ceded to Hungary.[PARAGRAPH:1]King Stephen died on the Feast of the Assumption in 1038 at Szekesfehervar, where he was then buried.</string>

He served as a military officer in the Indonesian National Revolution, but is better known as the long-reigning second President of Indonesia, holding the office from 1967 to 1998.[PARAGRAPH:1]Suharto seized power from his predecessor, the first president of Indonesia Sukarno, through a mixture of force and political maneuvering against the backdrop of foreign and domestic unrest. Over the three decades of his \"New Order\" regime, Suharto constructed a strong central government along militarist lines. An ability to maintain stability and an avowedly anti-Communist stance won him the economic and diplomatic patronage of several Western governments in the era of the Cold War. For almost all of his three-decade rule, Indonesia experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Suharto regime had won the favour of Western governments and institutions, however, in 1990's, its increasingly authoritarian and corrupt practices became a source of much discontent. After the 1990s brought end of the Cold War, Western concern over communism waned, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. In 1991, the murder of East Timorese civilians in a Dili cemetery, also known as the \"Santa Cruz Massacre\", caused American attention to focus on its military relations with the Suharto regime and the question of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor. In 1992,this attention resulted in the Congress of the United States passing limitations on IMET assistance to the Indonesian military, over the objections of President George H.W. Bush. In 1993, under President Bill Clinton, the U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission helped pass a resolution expressing deep concern over Indonesian human rights violations in East Timor. The Indonesian invasion and occupation of East Timor has been called the worst instance of genocide (relative to population) since the Holocaust.[PARAGRAPH:1]His almost unquestioned authority over Indonesian affairs slipped dramatically when the Asian financial crisis lowered Indonesians' standard of living and fractured his support among the nation's military, political and civil society institutions. After internal unrest and diplomatic isolation sapped his support in the mid-to-late 1990s, Suharto was forced to resign from the presidency in May 1998.[PARAGRAPH:1]After serving as the public face of Indonesia for over 30 years, Suharto now lives his post-presidential years in virtual seclusion. His legacy remains hotly debated and contested both in Indonesia and in foreign-policy debates in the West. Since his resignation, Suharto has retired to a family compound in Central Jakarta, making few public appearances. Efforts to prosecute Suharto have mostly centered around alleged mismanagement of funds, and their force has been blunted due to health concerns.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_SUKARNO_PEDIA">[H1]Kusno Sosrodhardijo[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]1st President of Indonesia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1901 - 1970 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The son of a Javanese primary school teacher, an aristocrat named Raden Soekemi Sosrodihardjo and his Balinese wife named Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai from Buleleng regency, Sukarno was born as Kusno Sosrodihardjo in Blitar, East Java in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Following Javanese custom, he was renamed after surviving a childhood illness. He was admitted into a Dutch-run school as a child. When his father sent him to Surabaya in 1916 to attend a secondary school, he met Tjokroaminoto, a future nationalist. In 1921 he began to study at the Technische Hogeschool (Technical Institute) in Bandung. He studied civil engineering and focused on architecture.  Atypically, even among the colony's small educated elite, Sukarno was fluent in several languages. In addition to the Javanese language of his childhood, he was a master of Sundanese, Balinese and of Indonesian, and especially strong in Dutch. He was also quite comfortable in German, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, all of which were taught at his HBS. He was helped by his photographic memory and precocious mind.  In his studies, Sukarno was \"intensely modern,\" both in architecture and in politics. Sukarno interpreted these ideas in his dress, in his urban planning for the capital (eventually Jakarta), and in his socialist politics, though he did not extend his taste for modern art to pop music; he had Koes Plus imprisoned for their allegedly decadent lyrics despite his reputation for womanising. For Sukarno, modernity was blind to race, neat and Western in style, and anti-imperialist.Sukarno became a leader of a pro-independence party, Partai Nasional Indonesia, when it was founded in 1927. He opposed imperialism and capitalism because he thought both systems worsened the life of Indonesian people.  He also hoped that Japan would commence a war against the western powers and that Java could then gain its independence with Japan's aid. He was arrested in 1929 by Dutch colonial authorities and sentenced to two years in prison. By the time he was released, he had become a popular hero. He was arrested several times during the 1930s and was in exile when Japan occupied the archipelago in 1942.Following the Japanese surrender, Sukarno, Hatta, and Dr. Radjiman Wediodiningrat were summoned by Marshal Terauchi, Commander-in-Chief of Japan's Southern Expeditionary Forces in Saigon. Sukarno, viewed by many as a competent leader of the time is forced by the youth groups to initially hesitate in declaring Indonesia's independence - the youth at the time felt that the news of Japanese surrender shall be taken as a golden chance to declare independence before the allies could re-establish a colonial rule in the area, yet Sukarno refused - he was afraid of any bloodbath and war which will be done by the base of suspecting the Indonesians of rebellion against the Japanese by the allied force which would soon take their power back. To force the deadlock to end,he and Mohammad Hatta were kidnapped by Indonesian youth groups to Rengasdengklok, Karawang, not far from Jakarta in order to prepare the Indonesian Independence. Finally Sukarno and Hatta declared the independence of the Republic of Indonesia on August 17, 1945.  Sukarno's government initially postponed the formation of a national army, for fear of antagonizing the Allied occupation forces and their doubt over whether they would have been able to form an adequate military apparatus to maintain control of seized territory. The various militia groups at that time were encouraged to join the BKRBadan Keamanan Rakyat  (The People's Security Organization)itself a subordinate of the \"War Victims Assistance Organization\". It was only in October 1945 that the BKR was reformed into the TKRTentara Keamanan Rakyat (The People's Security Army) in response to the increasing Dutch presence in Indonesia. In the ensuing chaos between various factions and Dutch attempts to re-establish colonial control, Dutch troops captured Sukarno in December 1948, but were forced to release him after the ceasefire. He returned to Jakarta in December 28, 1949. At this time, Indonesia adopted a new federal constitution that made the country a federal state. This was replaced by another provisional constitution  in 1950 that restored a unitary form of government. Both constitutions were parliamentary in nature, whichon paperlimited presidential power. However, even with his formally reduced role, he commanded a good deal of moral authority as Father of the Nation.  Sukarno's government was not universally accepted in Indonesia. Indeed, many factions and regions attempted to separate themselves from his government, and there were several internal conflicts even during the period of armed insurgency against the Dutch. One such example is the leftist-backed coup attempt by elements of the military in Madiun and Mt. Lawu Area, East Java in 1947, which was an attempt to change the NKRI (Unitary State of Republic of Indonesia) into RSI (Rep. Soviet Indonesia - Soviet of the Republic of Indonesia) by the leading PKI (Communist Party of Indonesia) party; many of the PKI partisans died and its power became dormant for the next 23 years, before in the late 1950s PKI start to dominate Indonesian politics again. Or attempts of coup such as the DI/TII (Darul Islam/Tentara Islam Indonesia - Darul Islam/Islam Army of Indonesia) coup in West Java, in which SM Kartosuwirjo and fellow separatists tried to create a NII (Negara Islam Indonesia - Islamic Country of Indonesia).In the 1950s he increased his ties to the People's Republic of China and admitted more Communists into his government. He also began to accept increasing amounts of Soviet bloc military aid. This aid, however, was surpassed by military aid from the Eisenhower  Administration, which worried about a leftward drift should Sukarno rely too much on Soviet bloc aid. However, Sukarno increasingly attempted to forge a new alliance called the \"New Emerging Forces\", as a counter to the old superpowers, whom he accused of spreading \"Neo-Colonialism, Colonialism and Imperialism\" (NEKOLIM). His political alliances gradually shifted towards Asian powers such as the PRC and North Korea. In 1961, this first president of Indonesia also found another political alliance, an organization, called the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM, in Indonesia known as Gerakan Non-Blok, GNB) with Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser, India's Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Yugoslavia's President Josip Broz Tito, and Ghana's President Kwame Nkrumah, in an action called The Initiative of Five (Sukarno, Nkrumah, Nasser, Tito, and Nehru). This action was a movement to not give any favour to the two superpower blocs, who were involved in the Cold War.  Sukarno also opposed the British-supported Federation of Malaysia, claiming that it was a neocolonial plot to advance British interests. In spite of his political overtures, which was partly justified when some political elements in British Borneo territories Sarawak and Brunei opposed the Federation plan and aligned themselves with Sukarno, Malaysia was proclaimed in September 1963. This led to the IndonesiaMalaysia confrontation (Konfrontasi). Domestically, Sukarno whipped up anti-British sentiment and the British Embassy was burned down. In 1964 Sukarno stirred up an anti-American campaign that saw American interests and businesses in Indonesia denounced and even attacked. As a result, US aid to Indonesia was halted. Sukarno withdrew Indonesia from the UN membership in 1965 when, with US backing, the nascent Federation of Malaysia took a seat of UN Security Council. With the government severely indebted to the Soviet Union, Sukarno turned to Communist China for support and spoke increasingly of a Peking-Jakarta axis.  Sukarno's increasing illness was demonstrated when he collapsed in public in August 9, 1965, and he was secretly diagnosed with kidney disease.On the night of 30 September 1965, six of Indonesia's most senior generals were killed by a movement calling themselves the \"30 September Movement\" (G30S) which claimed to be in control of the government. Major General Suharto, commander of the Army's strategic reserves, took control of the army the following morning.  Suharto issued an ultimatum to the Halim Air Force Base, where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno (the reasons for his presence are unclear and were subject of claim and counter-claim), Air Marshal Omar Dhani and Aidit had gathered. By the following day, it was clear that the incompetently organised and poorly coordinated coup had failed.  By 2 October, Suharto's faction was firmly in control of the army. Sukarno's obedience to Suharto's 1 October ultimatum to leave Halim is seen as changing all power relationships.  Sukarno's fragile balance of power between the military, political Islam, communists, and nationalists that underlay his \"Guided Democracy\" was now collapsing.  In early October, a military propaganda campaign began to sweep the country, successfully convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a Communist coup, and that the murders were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes. The PKI's denials of involvement had little effect.  The army led a campaign to purge Indonesian society, government and armed forces of the communist party and other leftist organisations. Leading PKI members were immediately arrested, some summarily executed.  The purge spread across the country with the worst massacres in Java and Bali.  In some areas the army organised civilian groups and local militias, in other areas communal vigilante action preceded the army.  The most widely accepted estimates are that at least half a million were killed.  It is thought that as many as 1.5 million were imprisoned at one stage or another.  As a result of the purge, one of Sukarno's three pillars of support, the Indonesian Communist Party, had been effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political Islam. The killings and the failure of his tenuous \"revolution\" distressed Sukarno and he tried unsuccessfully to maintain his influence appealing in a January 1966 broadcast for the country to follow him. Subandrio sought to create a Sukarnoist column (Barisan Sukarno), which was undermined by Suharto's pledge of loyalty to Sukarno and the concurrent instruction for all those loyal to Sukarno to announce their support for the army. In February, Sukarno reshuffled his cabinet, sacking Nasution as Defence Minister and abolishing his position of armed forces chief of staff, but Nasution refused to step down.  A meeting of Sukarno's full cabinet was held at the Presidential Palace on 11 March 1966. As students were demonstrating against the administration, unidentified troops began to assemble outside. Sukarno, Subandrio and another minister immediately left the meeting and went to the Bogor Palace by helicopter. Three generals were dispatched to the Bogor palace and they met with Sukarno who signed for them a Presidential Order known as Supersemar. Through the order, Sukarno assigned Suharto to \"take all measures considered necessary to guarantee security, calm and stability of the government and the revolution and to guarantee the personal safety and authority [of Sukarno]\". The authorship of the document, and whether Sukarno was forced to sign, perhaps even at gunpoint, is a point of historic debate. The effect of the order, however, was the transfer of authority to Suharto. After obtaining the Presidential Order, Suharto had the PKI declared illegal and the party was abolished. He also arrested many high ranking officials that were loyal to Sukarno on the charge of being PKI members and/or sympathizers, further reducing Sukarno's political power and influence.Sukarno was stripped of his presidential title by Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat Sementara (Provisional Peoples Representative Assembly) on March 12, 1967, led by his former ally, Nasution. He was arrested and remained under house arrest until his death from kidney failure in Jakarta on June 21, 1970 at age 69. He was buried in Blitar, East Java, Indonesia. In recent decades, his grave has been a significant venue in the network of places that Javanese visit on ziarah and for some is of equal significance to those of the Wali Songo.  While the semi-official version of the events of 19651966 claims that the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) ordered the murders of the six generals, others blame Sukarno, and still others believe Suharto orchestrated the assassinations to remove potential rivals for the presidency.</string>

Sonni Ali quickly established himself as the empire's most formidable military strategist and conqueror. [PARAGRAPH:1]His empire encompassed more landmass than all of western Europe and, to date, was the largest empire that Africa has ever seen. With his control of critical trade routes and cities such as Timbuktu, Sonni Ali brought great wealth to the Songhai Empire, which at its height would surpass the wealth of Mali.[PARAGRAPH:1]During his campaigns for expansion, Ali conquered many lands, repelling attacks from the Mossi to the south and overcoming the Dogon people to the north. He annexed Timbuktu in 1468, after Islamic leaders of the town requested his assistance in overthrowing marauding Tuares who had taken the city subsequently to the decline of Mali. [PARAGRAPH:1]However, Ali met stark resistance after setting his eyes on the wealthy and renowned trading town of Djenne. After a persistence seven-year siege, he was able to forcefully incorporate it into his vast empire in 1473, but only after having starved them into surrender. [PARAGRAPH:1]Ali imposed Islam on non-Muslims and forced them to abide by Islamic law. Due to his violent sack of Timbuktu, he was described as an intolerant tyrant in many Islamic accounts. [PARAGRAPH:1]In oral tradition, Sonni Ali is often known as a powerful politician and great military commander. Whatever the case may have been, his legend consists of him being a fearless conqueror who united a great empire, sparking a legacy that is still intact today. Under his reign, Djenne and Timbuktu were on their way to becoming great centers of learning.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_SVIATOSLAV_I_PEDIA">[H1]Sviatoslav I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prince of Kiev[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 942 - 972 AD [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Little is known about the childhood of Sviatoslav, which he spent reigning in Novgorod.  His father, Igor, was killed by the Drevlians around 942 and his mother, Olga, ruled as regent in Kiev until Sviatoslav was able.  His mother converted to Christianity at the court of Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus in 945, but Sviatoslav continued to worship the gods and goddesses of the Slavic pantheon.  He remained a stubborn pagan all of his life for he believed his warriors would ridicule him if he became a Christian.  The allegiance of his warriors was crucial in his later conquests. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Shortly after his accession to the throne, Sviatoslav began campaigning to expand the Kievan Rus's territory to the Pontic steppe region.  His greatest success was the conquest of Khazaria, which for centuries had been one of the strongest states of Eastern Europe.  Historians can infer that a dispute involving trade led to the initial rivalry between the two countries.  Sviatoslav then proceeded to gain the support of many of Khazaria's vassals.  Those not willing to help were forced to pay tribute.  Sviatoslav then continued to invade Volga Bulgaria and demand tribute from the population.  He employed mercenaries from both Khazaria and Bulgaria because of their superior cavalry.  He also sacked several of the Khazar cities, including the capital, Atil.  Sviatoslav's conquests of these areas now opened up new trade routes previously dominated by the Khazars. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Sviatoslav was later paid by the Byzantines to help them in their war against Bulgaria.  Sviatoslav defeated the Bulgarian ruler Boris II and proceeded to occupy the whole northern Bulgaria.  Sviatoslav moved the capital to a more strategic location, and invaded Bulgaria again in 969.  He devastated Thrace and massacred the city of Philippopolis's inhabitants.  A new Byzantine emperor, John Tzimiskes, later attempted to persuade Sviatoslav into leaving Bulgaria, but failed.  Sviatoslav responded by laying siege to Adrianople, causing panic in Constantinople.  Sviatoslav was met by the Byzantine army at the Battle of Arcadiopolis and lost.  The Byzantine emperor then proceeded to liberate the Balkans from Sviatoslav, causing Sviatoslav to retreat to Dorostol.  The Byzantine armies continued to besiege Dorostol, causing Sviatoslav to come to terms with John and abandon the Balkans.  Fearing that the peace with Sviatoslav would not last, the Byzantine emperor persuaded the Pecheneg Khan Kurya to kill Sviatoslav before he reached Kiev.  </string>

He was the last ruler of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, the so-called Ethiopian Dynasty, and was driven out of Lower Egypt by the Assyrians as they began to conquer Egypt. [PARAGRAPH:1]When Shabaka conquered Lower Egypt and thus asserted Nubian rule, he was accompanied by his nephew Taharqa, who was about age 20. Later, during Shabaka's reign as pharaoh, Egypt confronted the growing might of Assyria on the battlefield. Taharqa was at the head of the Egyptian army, but it is not clear whether the two forces actually fought. Taharqa's brother Shabataka succeeded Shabaka, and he made Taharqa his coregent in order to assure his succession. About 688 BC, approximately 23 years after Nubian rule had been imposed over Egypt, Taharqa assumed the throne in his own right. [PARAGRAPH:1]The next few years were peaceful, and Taharqa moved his capital to Tanis in the Delta so that he could stay well informed about events in the neighboring Asian countries. By 671 BC Egypt and Assyria again approached a confrontation, so Taharqa prepared to fight for the continued survival of Egypt. But the Assyrian king, Esarhaddon, crossed the Sinai Desert and defeated Taharqa's army on the frontier. In 2 weeks he was besieging Memphis. The Egyptian army crumbled under the attack of the better-disciplined Assyrian army, which was armed with iron weapons. [PARAGRAPH:1]Taharqa fled to Upper Egypt, leaving Esarhaddon to take control of Lower Egypt. Two years later Taharqa returned with a fresh army and managed to recover control of the Delta, but this success was short-lived, and Esarhaddon's successor, Ashurbanipal, drove Taharqa south again. After this final defeat he never again tried to campaign in the north. Egypt then entered into a long era of successive foreign rulers. [PARAGRAPH:1]During his period of Egyptian rule Taharqa had encouraged many architectural projects, as had his Nubian predecessors. He indulged in rebuilding the temple at Kawa, across the Nile from present-day Dongola, which became a major center for the Nubian kings. He erected monuments at Karnak, Thebes, and Tanis in Lower Egypt, and he built a number of important temples in Kush, as the Upper Egyptian Nubian state was then known. During the last 8 years of his life in Kush, he continued to foster his architectural interests. [PARAGRAPH:1]It was during his reign that Egypt's enemy Assyria at last invaded Egypt. Esarhaddon led several campaigns against Taharqa, which he recorded on several monuments. His first attack in 677 BC, aimed to pacify Arab tribes around the Dead Sea, led him as far as the Brook of Egypt. Esarhaddon invaded Egypt proper in Taharqa's 17th regnal year, after Esarhaddon had settled a revolt at Ashkelon. Taharqa defeated the Assyrians on that occasion, but three years later (671 BC) the Assyrian king captured and sacked Memphis, where he captured numerous members of the royal family. Taharqa fled to the south, and Esarhaddon reorganized the political scene in the north, establishing Necho I of the 26th dynasty as king at Sais. [PARAGRAPH:1]Upon the Assyrian king's departure, however, Taharqa intrigued in the affairs of Lower Egypt, and fanned numerous revolts. Esarhaddon died before he could return to Egypt, and it was left to his heir Assurbanipal to once again invade Egypt. Assurbanipal defeated Taharqa, who afterwards fled first to Thebes, then up the Nile into Nubia. After appointing Tantamani, the son of Shabaka, as his successor, he died in exile and was buried at El-Kurru.</string>

Although Timur was not a direct male-line descendant of the great Khan Genghis, he claimed descent from one of Genghis' granddaughters and took two of Genghis's descendants as his wives to link himself to Genghis. He was Turkic in identity and language, and he aspired to restore the Mongol Empire. He was also steeped in Persian culture and in most of the territories which he incorporated, Persian was the primary language of administration and literary culture. Thus the language of the settled diwan was Persian and its scribes had to be adept in Persian culture, regardless of ethnicity. In addition to this, during his reign Turkic became a state and literary language, and some of the greatest contributions to Turkic literature were made during the Timurid era. Turkic culture was restored from the Mongol expansion and flourished. Major Turkic cultural sites like the Ahmad Yasavi shrine were constructed. Timur's short-lived empire consolidated the Turco-Persian cultural synthesis in Transoxiania: a literary form of Chaghatay Turkish was used alongside Persian as both cultural and official language.[PARAGRAPH:1]Timur was a military genius and loved to play chess in his spare time to improve his military tactics and skill. His troops were essentially Turkic-speaking. He wielded absolute power, yet never called himself more than an emir, and eventually ruled in the name of tamed Chingizid Khans, who were little more than political prisoners. His heaviest blow was against the Mongol Golden Horde, which never recovered after his campaign against Tokhtamysh. Despite wanting to restore the Mongol Empire, Timur was more at home in a city than on a steppe as evidenced by his funding of construction in Samarkand. He thought of himself as a ghazi, but his biggest wars were against Muslim states.[PARAGRAPH:1]He died during his campaign against the Ming Dynasty, yet records indicate that for part of his life he was a surreptitious Ming vassal, and even his son Shah Rukh visited China in 1420. He ruled over an empire that, in modern times, extends from southeastern Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait and Iran, through Central Asia encompassing part of Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, North-Western India, and even approaching Kashgar in China. Northern Iraq remained predominantly Assyrian Christian until the destructions of Timur.[PARAGRAPH:1]Timur's military talents were unique. He is known to have employed what is known nowadays as information warfare. Timur's campaigns were preceded by spies whose tasks included collecting information and spreading horrifying reports about the cruelty, size and might of his armies - eventually weakening the morale of the population and causing panic among enemy forces.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sources claim that when Timur conquered Persia, Iraq and Syria, the civilian population was decimated. In the city of Isfahan, he ordered the building of a pyramid of 70,000 human skulls, from those that his army had beheaded, and a pyramid of some 20,000 skulls was erected outside of Aleppo. Timur herded thousands of citizens of Damascus into the Cathedral Mosque before setting it aflame, and had 70,000 people beheaded in Tikrit, and 90,000 more in Baghdad. As many as 17 million people may have died from his conquests.</string>

He spent much of his life attempting to rally disparate Native American tribes in a mutual defense of their lands, which eventually culminated in his death in the War of 1812. Tecumseh was greatly admired in his day, remains a respected icon for Native Americans, and is considered a national hero in Canada. Even his longtime adversary William Henry Harrison considered Tecumseh to be \"one of those uncommon geniuses which spring up occasionally to produce revolutions and overturn the established order of things.\" [PARAGRAPH:1]Tecumseh's name (which translates as \"I Cross the Way\" or \"A Panther Crouching for His Prey\") was a reference to his family clan. In the late 1780s and together with his brother Tenskwatawa, Tecumseh attempted to form an alliance of the Native American inhabitants of the upper Midwest and Ohio River valley and Great Lakes area against the expansion of white settlers. The alliance had a number of membership changes, but at one time or another it included representatives from the Shawnee, Canadian Iroquois, Wyandot, Mingo, Ottawa, Chickamauga, Miami, Kickapoo, Lenni Lenape, Ojibway, Potawatomi, Fox, Sauk, and Mascouten nations. [PARAGRAPH:1]On November 7, 1811, a US force under the command of future President William Henry Harrison attacked Elskwatawa at the Battle of Tippecanoe, wiping out Elskwatawa's camp and putting an end to Tecumseh's hope of a broad Native American alliance. Tension was mounting between the US and the United Kingdom, and the War of 1812 broke out early the following year. Tecumseh took a force north, where they enlisted as allies of the British. [PARAGRAPH:1]Tecumseh joined British Major-General Sir Isaac Brock to force the surrender of Detroit in August 1812, a major victory for the British. Tecumseh's acumen in warfare was evident in this engagement. As Brock advanced to a point just out of range of Detroit's guns, Tecumseh had his warriors parade out from a nearby wood and circle around to repeat the maneuver, making it appear that there were many more than was actually the case. The fort commander, Brigadier General William Hull, surrendered in fear of the ruin of the fort. [PARAGRAPH:1]Tecumseh is honoured in Canada as a tragic hero who was a brilliant war chief who, along with Brock, saved Canada from US invasion when all seemed hopeless, but could not save his own people.</string>

He is the head of the government-in-exile based in Dharamshala, India.  Tibetans traditionally believe him to be the reincarnation of his predecessors.The Dalai Lama was born fifth of 16 children to a farming family in the village of Taktser. His first language was, in his own words, \"a broken Xining language which was (a dialect of) the Chinese language\" as his family did not speak the regional Amdo dialect.  He was proclaimed the tulku or rebirth of the 13th Dalai Lama at the age of two. In 1950 the army of the People's Republic of China invaded the region. One month later, on 17 November 1950, he was enthroned formally as Dalai Lama: at the age of fifteen, he became the region's most important spiritual leader and political ruler.In 1951 the Chinese military pressured the Dalai Lama to ratify a seventeen-point agreement which permitted the People's Republic of China to take control of Tibet. He fled through the mountains to India soon after the failed 1959 uprising, and the effective collapse of the Tibetan resistance movement. In India he established a government-in-exile.The most influential member of the Gelugpa or Yellow Hat sect, he has considerable influence over the other sects of Tibetan Buddhism.  The Chinese government regards him as the symbol of an outmoded theocratic system.  Along with the 80,000 or so exiles that followed him, the Dalai Lama strives to preserve traditional Tibetan education and culture.Conditions in Tibet have in more recent years caused an international protest movement, including the attempted disruption of the 2008 Olympic Games.  In March 2008 the Dalai Lama asked for an international inquiry into China's treatment of Tibet, which he said amounted to cultural genocide.  A noted public speaker worldwide, the Dalai Lama is often described as charismatic.  He is the first Dalai Lama to travel to the West, where he seeks to spread Buddhist teachings and to promote ethics and interfaith harmony. In 1989 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  He was given honorary Canadian citizenship in 2006, and was awarded the United States Congressional Gold Medal during October 2007.  He has received more than 100 honorary conferments and major awards.  On 17 December 2008, after months of speculation, the Dalai Lama announced his semi-retirement. He said that the future course of the movement he had directed for nearly five decades would now be decided by the elected parliament-in-exile with the prime minister Samdhong Rinpoche. The 73-year-old Nobel laureate, who recently had surgery, told reporters in Dharamsala, \"I have grown old.... It is better if I retire completely and get out of the way of the Tibetan movement.\"</string>

After the death of Agron (250 BC - 231 BC) who established a kingdom of Illyria, extending from Dalmatia on the north to the Aous (Vjosa river) River on the south with Shkodra as its capital, his widow, Teuta, acted as regent for her young stepson Pinnes. Teuta's first decision was to drive the Greek colonies off the Albanian coast. Attempting this, she found Durres too well fortified but Finiq farther south surrendered. While her Illyrian ships were off the coast of Saranda they intercepted and plundered some merchant vessels of Rome. Encouraged by this success, Teuta's pirates extended their operations southward in the Ionian Sea, westward along the coast of Italy, and were soon feared as the terror of the Adriatic.[PARAGRAPH:1] The Roman Senate sent two ambassadors to the pirate lair at Shkodra to require reparations and demand an end to the piratical expeditions. Apparently she told the ambassadors that according to the law of the Illyrians, piracy was a lawful trade and that her government had no right to interfere with this as a private enterprise. One of the envoys is repored to have replied that in that case Rome would make it her business to introduce better law among the Illyrians. At any rate, one of the ambassadors addressed the queen so disrespectfully that her attendants killed him as he embarked for Rome.[PARAGRAPH:1] This was too much for Rome to endure. In 229 BC, Rome declared war on Illyria and for the first time armies crossed the Adriatic to Illyria (the Balkan Peninsula in modern usage). The Roman fleet of 200 ships went first to Corcyra. Teuta's governor, Demetrius had little alternative but to surrender, and the Romans awarded him a considerable part of Teuta's holdings (228 BC). The Roman army then landed farther north at Apollonia. The combined army and navy proceeded northward together, subduing one town after another and besieging Shkodra, the capital. Teuta finally surrendered in 227 BC, having to accept an ignominious peace. The Romans allowed her to continue her reign but restricted her to a narrow region around Shkodra, deprived her of all her other holdings, and forbade her to sail an armed ship below Lissus (Lezha) just south of the capital. They also required her to pay an annual tribute and to acknowledge the final authority of Rome. Thus the damage was done. Thanks to Queen Teuta the expanding empire of Rome had learned the military route to the Balkan peninsula.</string>

Not long after Theodoric became king, the two men worked out an arrangement beneficial to both sides. The Ostrogoths needed a place to live, and Zeno was having serious problems with Odoacer, the King of Italy who had overthrown the Western Roman Empire  in 476. Ostensibly a viceroy for Zeno, Odoacer was menacing Byzantine territory and not respecting the rights of Roman citizens in Italy. At Zeno's encouragement, Theodoric invaded Odoacer's kingdom.Theodoric came with his army to Italy in 488, where he won the battles of Isonzo and Verona in 489 and at the Adda in 490. In 493 he took Ravenna. On February 2, 493, Theodoric and Odoacer signed a treaty that assured both parties would rule over Italy. A banquet was organised in order to celebrate this treaty. It was at this banquet that Theodoric, after making a toast, killed Odoacer with his own hands.Like Odoacer, Theodoric was ostensibly only a viceroy for the emperor in Constantinople. In reality, he was able to avoid imperial supervision, and dealings between the emperor and Theodoric were as equals. Unlike Odoacer, however, Theodoric respected the agreement he had made and allowed Roman citizens within his kingdom to be subject to Roman law and the Roman judicial system. The Goths, meanwhile, lived under their own laws and customs. In 519, when a mob had burned down the synagogues of Ravenna, Theodoric ordered the town to rebuild them at its own expense.Theodoric the Great sought alliances with, or hegemony over, the other Germanic kingdoms in the west. He allied with the Franks by his marriage to Audofleda, sister of Clovis I, and married his own female relatives to princes or kings of the Visigoths, Vandals and Burgundian. He stopped the Vandals from raiding his territories by threatening the weak Vandal king Thrasamund with invasion, and sent a guard of 5,000 troops with his sister Amalafrida when she married Thrasamund in 500. For much of his reign, Theodoric was the de facto king of the Visigoths as well, becoming regent for the infant Visigothic king, his grandson Amalric, following the defeat of Alaric II by the Franks under Clovis in 507. The Franks were able to wrest control of Aquitaine from the Visigoths, but otherwise Theodoric was able to defeat their incursions.Thedoric's achievements began to unravel even before his death. He had married his daughter Amalasuntha to the Visigoth Eutharic, but Eutharic died in 522 or 523, so no lasting dynastic connection of Ostrogoths and Visigoths was established. In 522, the Catholic Burgundian king Sigismund killed his own son, Theodoric's grandson, Sergeric. Theodoric retaliated by invading the Burgundian kingdom and then annexing its southern part, probably in 523. The rest was ruled by Sigismund's Arian brother Godomar, under Gothic protection against the Franks who had captured Sigismund. This brought the territory ruled by Theodoric to its height, but in 523 or 524 the new Catholic Vandal king Hilderic imprisoned Amalfrida and killed her Gothic guard. Theodoric was planning an expedition to restore his power over the Vandal kingdom when he died in 526.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_TIGRANES_PEDIA">[H1]Tigranes II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Armenia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c. 140  55 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Tigranes had been a hostage until the age of 40 at the court of King Mithradates II of Parthia who defeated the Armenians in 105 BCE. Other sources give the date as much earlier, at around 112-111 BCE.  After the death of King Tigranes I in 95 BCE, Tigranes bought his freedom, according to Strabo, by handing over \"seventy valleys\" in Atropatene to the Parthians.  When he came to power, the foundation upon which Tigranes was to build his Empire was already in place, thanks to the founder of the Artaxiad Dynasty, Artaxias I, and subsequent kings. The mountains of Armenia, however, formed natural borders between the different regions of the country and as a result, the feudalistic nakharars had significant influence over the regions or provinces in which they were based. This did not suit Tigranes, who wanted to create a centralist empire. He thus proceeded by consolidating his power within Armenia before embarking on his campaign.  He deposed Artanes, the last king of Armenian Sophene and a descendant of Zariadres.During the First Mithridatic War (90-85 BCE), Tigranes supported Mithridates VI of Pontus but was careful not to become directly involved in the war.  He rapidly built up his power, allying with Mithridates VI of Pontus and marrying his daughter Cleopatra. Tigranes had agreed that he was to extend his influence in the East, while Mithridates was to conquer Roman land in Anatolia and in Europe. By creating a stronger Hellenistic state, Mithridates was to contend with the well-established Roman foothold in Europe.  At that time, the Romans had accused Mithridates of massacring about 80,000 Romans in the Anatolian province of Asia. Ultimately, the two kings' attempts to control Cappadocia, as well as the alleged massacres, resulted in Roman intervention. The senate decided on Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who was then one of the current consuls, to be commander of the army against Mithridates.In 83 BCE, after a bloody strife for the throne of Syria, governed by the Seleucids, the Syrians decided to choose Tigranes as the protector of their kingdom and offered him the crown of Syria.  Magadates was appointed as his governor in Antioch. He then conquered Phoenicia and Cilicia, effectively putting an end to the last remnants of the Seleucid Empire, though a few holdout cities appear to have recognized the shadowy boy-king Seleucus VII Philometor as the legitimate king during his reign. The southern border of his domain reached as far as Ptolemais (modern Akko). Many of the inhabitants of conquered cities were sent to his new metropolis of Tigranakert (Latin name, Tigranocerta).   its height, his empire extended from the Pontic Alps (in modern north-eastern Turkey) to Mesopotamia, and from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean. Tigranes apparently invaded territories as far away as Ecbatana and took the title king of kings which, at the time, according to their coins, even the Parthian kings did not assume. He was called \"Tigranes the Great\" by many Western historians and writers, such as Plutarch. The \"King of Kings\" never appeared in public without having four kings attending him. Cicero, referring to his success in the east, said that he \"made the Republic of Rome tremble before the prowess of his arms.\"  Armenian rulers prior to Tigranes did not issue coins, he being the first one to do so. He took up the Seleucid tradition and struck coins of great interest. These were minted at Antioch and Damascus, cities under his rule during his occupation of Syria from 83 to 69 BCE. They consist of tetradrachms and copper coins having on the obverse his portrait wearing a decorated Armenian tiara with ear-flaps. The reverse has a completely original design. There are the seated Tyche of Antioch and the river god Orontes at her feet. There are even specimens struck in gold.Mithridates had found refuge in Armenian land after confronting Rome, considering the fact that Tigranes was his ally and relative. The \"King of Kings\" eventually came into direct contact with Rome. The Roman commander, Lucullus, demanded the expulsion of Mithridates from Armenia - to comply with such a demand would be, in effect, to accept the status of vassal to Rome and this Tigranes refused.  Lucullus' reaction was an attack that was so precipitate that he took Tigranes by surprise. According to Roman historians, the messenger who first brought news of the unexpected Roman attack was executed.   Eventually Mithrobazanes, one of Tigranes generals, told Tigranes of the Roman approach. Tigranes was, according to Keaveney, so impressed by Mithrobazanes' courage that he appointed Mithrobazanes to command an army against Lucullus - Mithrobazanes was however defeated and killed.  After this defeat Tigranes withdrew north to Armenia to regroup which left Lucullus free to put Tigranocerta under siege.  When Tigranes had gathered a large army he returned to confront Lucullus. On October 6, 69 BCE, Tigranes' much larger force was decisively defeated by the Roman army under Lucullus in the Battle of Tigranocerta. Tigranes' treatment of the inhabitants (the majority of the population had been forced to move to the city) led disgruntled city guards to open the gates of the city to the Romans. Learning of this, Tigranes hurriedly sent 6000 cavalrymen to the city in order to rescue his wives and some of his assets. Tigranes escaped capture with a small escort.  On the 6 October 68 BCE, the Romans approached the old capital of Artaxata. Tigranes' and Mithridates' combined Armeno-Pontian army of 70,000 men formed up to face them but were resoundingly defeated. Once again, both Mithridates and Tigranes evaded capture by the victorious Romans.  The long campaigning and hardships that Lucullus' troops had endured for years, combined with a perceived lack of reward in the form of plunder, led to successive mutinies among the legions in 68-67. Frustrated by the rough terrain of Northern Armenia and seeing the worsening moral of his troops, Lucullus moved back south and put Nisibis under siege. Tigranes concluded (wrongly) that Nisibis would hold out and sought to regain those parts of Armenia that the Romans had captured.  Despite his continuous success in battle, Lucullus could still not capture either one of the monarchs. With Lucullus' troops now refusing to obey his commands, but agreeing to defend positions from attack, the senate sent Gnaeus Pompey to recall Lucullus to Rome and take over his command.  In 67 BCE Pompey was given the task of defeating Mithradates and Tigranes.  Pompey first concentrated on attacking Mithradates while distracting Tigranes by engineering a Parthian attack on Gordyeyne.  Phraates III, the Parthian king was soon persuaded to take things a little further than an anexation of Gordyeyne when a son of Tigranes (also named Tigranes) went to join the Parthians and persuaded Phraates to invade Armenia in an attempt to replace the elder Tigranes with the younger.  Tigranes decided not to meet the invasion in the field but instead ensured that his capital, Artaxata, was well defended and withdrew to the hill country. Phraates soon realized that Artaxata would not fall without a protracted siege, the time for which he could not spare due his fear of plots at home. Once Phraates left Tigranes came back down from the hills and drove his son from Armenia. The son then fled to Pompey.  In 66 BCE, Pompey advanced into Armenia with the younger Tigranes, and Tigranes the Great, now almost 75 years old, surrendered. Pompey treated him generously and allowed him to retain his kingdom shorn of his conquests in return for 6,000 talents of silver. His unfaithful son was sent back to Rome as a prisoner.  Tigranes continued to rule Armenia as an ally of Rome until his death in 55/54.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_TITO_PEDIA">[H1]Josip Broz Tito [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Yugoslavia [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1892 - 1980[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Rise to power[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB] The son of a blacksmith in a Croatian village, Tito fought in Russia with the Austro-Hungarian army in World War I and was captured by the Russians. He served with distinction in the Red Army during the Russian civil war of 1918 to 1920. Several years later Broz returned to Croatia and, while a metalworker, became a prominent union organizer. He was (1929 - 34) imprisoned as a political agitator. In 1937 the Comintern assigned to him the reorganization of the Yugoslav Communist party, and in 1941 he emerged as a leader of Yugoslav partisan resistance forces after the defeat and occupation of Yugoslavia by the Axis Powers. It was then that he adopted the name Tito.Although the core of his partisan army was Communist, Tito's rapidly growing forces included many non-Communists. Despite the opposition of the Yugoslav government in exile, which supported the Serbian resistance leader Draga Mihajlovic, Tito's army and its successes soon eclipsed those of Mihajlovic and his chetniks. Among the causes of his success were his swift guerrilla tactics, his own magnetic personality, and the appeal of his political programòÀÔa federated YugoslaviaòÀÔto the non-Serbian elements of the population. Although they cooperated at first, Tito and Mihajlovic soon clashed.By 1943, Tito headed a large army and controlled a sizable part of Yugoslavia, centered in Bosnia. Tito was supported from the first by the USSR, but in 1944 he also received the full support of Britain and the United States. In Nov., 1944, after the liberation of Belgrade, he negotiated a merger of the royal Yugoslav government and his own council of national liberation, and in Mar., 1945, he became head of the new federal Yugoslav government.Already the virtual dictator of Yugoslavia, he won a major electoral victory in Nov., 1945, at the head of the Communist-dominated National Liberation Front, whose candidates were the only ones permitted to run in the election. With the opposition abstaining, Tito won almost 80% of the vote. King Peter II was deposed, and a republic was proclaimed.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Tito's Dictatorship[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]As premier and minister of defense from 1945, Marshal Tito ruled Yugoslavia dictatorially. He suppressed internal opposition by such measures as the execution of Mihajlovic and the jailing (1946) of Archbishop Stepinac of Zagreb, and he nationalized Yugoslav industry and undertook a planned economy. He did not attempt to collectivize the land of the Yugoslav small farmers, but he forced them, under threat of severe penalties, to furnish large portions of their produce to the state.Although Yugoslavia was closely associated with the USSR and was a leading member of the Cominform, Tito often pursued independent policies and did not hesitate to curtail the activities of Soviet agents. In 1948 the Cominform accused Tito of having deviated from the correct Communist line. Tito denied the charges and refused to submit to the Cominform, from which Yugoslavia was then expelled.Having already transformed Yugoslavia into an armed camp, built up a highly efficient secret police, and purged dissident elements in the Communist party, Tito succeeded in maintaining his position despite the hostility of the USSR and his neighbors. Although he accepted loans from the Western powers, he initially did not alter his internal program. In later years, however, he relaxed many of the regime's strict controls, particularly those affecting the small farmers. As a result, Yugoslavia became the most liberal Communist country of Europe.On close terms with President Nasser of Egypt and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Tito unsuccessfully tried to develop common policies among nonaligned nations. Relations with the USSR were alternately friendly and hostile. In 1968, together with the Romanian party chief, Nicolae Ceausescu, Tito led the opposition to the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia.Tito was repeatedly reelected president from his first term in 1953, and in 1963 his term was made unlimited. In an effort to provide for succession to the leadership after his death, Tito established (1971) a 22-member collective presidency composed of the presidents of the 6 republican and 2 autonomous provincial assemblies and 14 members chosen from the republican and provincial assemblies for 5-year terms. In July, 1971, Tito was elected chairman of the new presidency.During the 1970s the economy began to weaken under the weight of foreign debt, high inflation, and inefficient industry. Also, he was under increasing pressure from nationalist forces within Yugoslavia, especially Croatian secessionists who threatened to break up the federation. Following their repression, Tito tightened control of intellectual life. After his death in 1980, the ethnic tensions resurfaced, helping to bring about the eventual violent breakup of the federation in the early 1990s.</string>

Tugrul united the Turkomen  warriors of the Great Eurasian Steppes into a confederacy of tribes, who traced their ancestry to a single ancestor named Seljuk, and led them in conquest of eastern Iran. He would later establish the Seljuk Sultanate after conquering Persia and retaking the Abbasid Capital of Baghdad from the Buyid Dynasty in 1055. Tugrul relegated the Abbassid Caliphs  to state figureheads and took command of the caliphate's armies in military offensives against the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate in an effort to expand his empire's borders and unite the Islamic world.  He ascended to power c. 1016. In 1025 he, and his brother Chaghri (Çagri) served under the Kara-Khanids of Bukhara, but they were defeated by the Ghaznavid Empire under Mahmud of Ghazni, and Togrul was forced to flee to Khwarezm while Arslan settled in Khorasan. When their uncle was later driven out of Khorasan by Mahmud, Togrul and his brother moved onto Khorasan and conquered the cities of Merv and Nishapur in 10281029. They then extended their raids to Bokhara and Balkh and in 1037 sacked Ghazni and in 1038 he was crowned Sultan at Nishapur. In 1040 they decisively won the Battle of Dandanaqan against Mahmud's son, Mas'ud I forcing Mas'ud I to abandon his western provinces and flee towards Lahore. Togrul then installed Chagri to govern Khorasan and prevent a Ghaznavid reconquest, then moved on to the conquest of the Iranian plateau in 1040-1044. By 1054 his forces were contending in Anatolia with the Byzantines and in 1055 he was commissioned by the Abbassid Caliph Al-Qa'im (caliph) to recapture Baghdad from the Fatimids. A revolt by Turkmen forces under his foster brother Ibrahim Yinal, Buyid forces and an uprising against the Seljuks led to the loss of the city to the Fatimids Caliph in 1058. Two years later Togrul crushed the rebellion, personally strangling Ibrahmin with his bowstring and entered Baghdad. He then married the daughter of the Abbasid Caliph.  He died childless in the city of Rayy in modern Iran and was succeeded by his nephew Suleiman which was contested by Alp Arslan, both of them sons of his brother Chagri Begh. His cousin Kutalmish who had both been a vital part of his campaigns and later a supporter of Yinal's rebellion also put forth a claim. Alp Arslan defeated Kutalmish for the throne and succeed on April 27th, 1064.</string>

He reigned from 910 until his death and declared himself the first King of the medieval Croatian state in 925.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was crowned king at the fields of Tomislavgrad in 925 by order of Pope John X. During his life he united the Pannonian and Dalmatian duchies to form a Croatian Kingdom. Under his rule, Croatia became one of the most powerful kingdoms in medieval Europe.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was member of the Trpimirovic dynasty and probably the son of Dalmatian duke (knez) Mutimir. Tomislav himself became duke of Dalmatia around 910.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav defeated the Magyars in battle and forced them across the Drava River. Since then this river has been the age-old border between these two people. Tomislav also annexed Sava Croatia to his state. This included the area between the rivers Drava, Sava and Kupa, which would later be known as Slavonia. This was the first time that the two Croatian principalities were united.[PARAGRAPH:1]King Tomislav allied himself with the Byzantine Empire, and had to repel the attacks of the Bulgarians who invaded Croatia due to Tomislav's friendship with the Byzantines. The Croats fought the army of Simeon I of Bulgaria led by duke Alobogotur on May 27, 927 and won Battle of the Bosnian Highlands. This huge battle is considered to be one of the greatest and bloodiest single-day battles in history. As ally of the Byzantium, he was granted the right to administer the coastal cities (Zadar, Split, Trogir, so-called Byzantine Dalmatia) and thus rounded off his state from the Adriatic Sea to the Drava River, and from the Rasa River in Istria to the Drina River.[PARAGRAPH:1]After he became King in 925, at two church synods in Split, he established the relationship between the dioceses of Split (Latin) and of Nin (Croatian), and in this way strengthened internal relations in Croatia and resolved the dispute around the liturgical language between the Latinists and Croatian Glagolites (users of Glagolitic alphabet). Through this, Tomislav obtained the support of the Pope, who was at that time the most important power in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav's organized a strong military state. His army and navy was consisted of, approximately, 100,000 infantry, 60,000 cavaliers, 80 large and 100 smaller battleships.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav disappeared in 928, and it is still not known where or how he actually died. At the time of his death there was discord in the country over whether the liturgical language of the Roman Catholic Church in Croatia would be Latin or Croatian.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tomislav is celebrated as the founder of the first united Croatian state. In the Croatian capital of Zagreb, there is a square dedicated to Tomislav. Near the place where he was crowned lies the town of Tomislavgrad (Tomislav's City).</string>

They fled south, where they were able to defeat the Maya at the city of Chichen Itza, and take it for their own. An interesting twist in Topiltzin's legend is that he vowed to return to Tula from the east in one of his sacred years and take his vengeance.

Some of his tactics are currently studied in several war academies around the world. [PARAGRAPH:1]Lautaro was the son of a mapuche \"Lonko\" (chief for times of peace). When young, he was captured by some Spanish colonizers, and became the personal servant of Don Pedro de Valdivia, Spanish conqueror of Chile. Lautaro learned the military ways and skills of the Spaniards' army by observing Valdivia and his peers. Lautaro escaped from Spanish captivity and rejoined the mapuches as a young adult. With the knowledge he had acquired, he introduced use of horses to the Mapuche, and designed improved tactics for combat against the Spanish. He attracted a large number of otherwise dispersed Mapuche warriors and formed a native army that could fight successfully against the Spanish conquerors. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1553 the Mapuches held a parliament in which, given the growing Spanish forces and their decision to remain in the territory, it was decided that war was needed to expel them. They chose him as Toqui (wartime chief) because he had served as an assistant for the Spanish cavalry, and was assumed he would know how to fight the conquistadors. [PARAGRAPH:1]He is considered an icon of the War of Arauco and the first Chilean General, for his revolutionary strategies and the responsibility in uniting the dispersed Mapuche people. His name was used by Francisco de Miranda when he founded the Logia Lautaro, an American independence society of the end of 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. Lautaro became a key protagonist in the epic poem La Araucana by Alonso de Ercilla, a major piece of literature about the Spanish conquest of America. In addition, he is also the subject of a poem by Chilean Nobel Literature Prize laureate Pablo Neruda. After this action, Lautaro planned an assault on Santiago, for which he drew scant support from his troops, who soon dwindled to only 600. In October of 1556 he reached in his northward march the river Mataquito, where he destroyed a fortified camp at Peteroa. In Peteroa he repulsed small attacking Spanish forces, first under the command of Diego Cano and later Francisco de Villagra himself. Lautaro retreated towards the river Itata, with the Spaniards in pursuit. From there he launched feelers towards Santiago and instead of confronting them, he gave them the slip and left for the city to attack it. Despite the stealth under which the Mapuches moved, the city leaders knew of the advance, and sent a small expedition to detain them, buying time for word to be sent to Villagra to return to the city. The Spanish forces met in the field, and, presumably by the treason of a fellow Araucano, found out about the disposition of Lautaro's camp. On April 29, 1557 the conquistadors launched a surprise attack from the hills of Caune, obtaining a decisive victory in which Lautaro was killed.</string>

Born in Saint Domingue, in a long struggle for independence Toussaint led enslaved Africans to victory over Europeans, abolished slavery, and secured native control over the colony in 1797 while nominally governor of the colony. He expelled the French commissioner Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, as well as the British armies; invaded Santo Domingo to free the slaves there; and wrote a constitution naming himself governor-for-life that established a new polity for the colony.[PARAGRAPH:1]Especially between the years 1800 and 1802, Toussaint L'ouverture tried to rebuild the collapsed economy of Haiti and reestablish commercial contacts with the United States and Great Britain. His rule permitted the colony a taste of freedom which, after his death in exile, was gradually destroyed during the successive reigns of a series of despots. Translated from French, his name means \"the awakening of all saints\" or \"all souls rising\". His last words were to his son in France, \"My boy, you will one day go back to St. Domingo; forget that France murdered your father.\"[PARAGRAPH:1]Toussaint L'Ouverture was born into slavery in the Plaine du Nord of what was then Saint-Domingue. He was born on the Bréda plantation of Bayon de Libertat, near Cap Français. Tradition says that his father was an African named Gaou-Guinou and probably a member of the Arada ethnic group. Toussaint Breda was lucky enough to be educated and to be literate. He read widely in French literature of the Enlightenment. He worked as a carriage driver and horse trainer on the plantation. His master freed him at age 33, when Toussaint married Suzanne. He was a fervent Catholic, and a member of high degree of the Masonic Lodge of Saint-Domingue. In 1791 slaves in the Plaine du Nord rose in rebellion. Different forces coalesced under different leaders. Toussaint served with other leaders and rose in responsibility. On April 4, 1792, the French Legislative Assembly extended full rights of citizenship to free people of color or mulattoes (gens de couleur libres) and free blacks. In Saint-Domingue, this policy was resisted by many white colonists, although France sent three Commissioners to enforce it.[PARAGRAPH:1]As unrest and racial war continued to disrupt Saint-Domingue's institutions, Toussaint joined the Spanish army of Santo Domingo to find a way to end slavery. In August Sonthonax proclaimed emancipation for slaves in the north, where Toussaint and his allies were fighting; his fellow commissioners announced emancipation of slaves in the West and South, but the invasion by British troops in September overshadowed these changes. In 1793 Toussaint adopted as a surname his nickname of Louverture and used that as his full signature from then on.[PARAGRAPH:1]By early 1794 Toussaint Louverture was able to organize 4,000 blacks (with some white and mulatto officers) into a band of loyal guerrilla troops, as he was a gifted, although untrained, leader and military strategist, and he used elements of western discipline for his troops. It was not until February 1794 that the French Convention formally abolished slavery. Toussaint negotiated with General Laveaux and changed sides in May 1794. He then fought against the Spanish, recovering all the forts of the Cordon de L'Ouest in less than two weeks and \"delivering\" the North to the French Republic. He also fought against the English.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1801 the Spanish capitulated to Toussaint Louverture, ceding the remainder of the island to his forces. He proclaimed the abolition of slavery in Santo Domingo. After this in July he proclaimed a new constitution which named him governor for life.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_TRUDEAU_PEDIA">[H1]Pierre Elliot Trudeau [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Canada[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1919 - 2000[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Trudeau was a charismatic figure who dominated the Canadian political scene, arousing passionate reactions. \"He haunts us still,\" one biography begins. Admirers praise the force of Trudeau's intellect. They salute his political acumen in preserving national unity and bringing into force the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Detractors fault Trudeau for arrogance, deplore economic policies that increased the national debt, and criticize him for increasing a sense of political alienation in western provinces. Nevertheless, few would dispute the assertion that Trudeau was a towering figure who helped redefine Canada.[PARAGRAPH:1]Trudeau led Canada through some of its most tumultuous times and was often the centre of controversy. Known for his flamboyance, he sometimes wore sandals in the House of Commons; dated celebrities; occasionally used obscenities to insult his opponents and on May 7, 1977, did a pirouette behind the back of Queen Elizabeth II. He was also known as an author, political activist, and professor from early in his adult life. As prime minister, he patriated the Canadian Constitution from the British Parliament to Canada and incorporated in it the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[PARAGRAPH:1]Born in Montreal, Trudeau earned a law degree at the Universite de Montreal in 1943, followed by a master's in political economy at Harvard. During his attendance at the Universite de Montreal,Trudeau was conscripted into the army, and joined the Canadian Officers Training Corps under the wartime National Resources Mobilization Act of 1940. Trudeau served with other conscripts in the home guard, since it was only later, starting in 1944, that limited numbers of conscripts were sent overseas, with the vast majority of those sent overseas being volunteers. He said he was willing to become involved in the war, but he believed that to do so would be to turn his back on a Quebec population he considered to have been betrayed by the Mackenzie King government. In a 1942 Outremont by-election, he campaigned for the Quebec anti-conscription candidate Jean Drapeau (see Conscription Crisis of 1944), and was eventually expelled from the Officers' Training Corps for lack of discipline. After the war, he attended the Institut d'etudes politiques de Paris in Paris in 1946-47, and spent the following year at the London School of Economics.[PARAGRAPH:1]As prime minister, Trudeau espoused participatory democracy as a means of making Canada a \"Just Society\". His desire for greater citizen involvement in government appears to have been frustrated by lack of support within his party, and he later opposed greater involvement for citizens in representative democracy. He vigorously defended the newly implemented universal health care and regional development programs as means of making society more just. In foreign affairs, Trudeau was not always in line with the Americans. He made Canada the first western power to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and went on a state visit to Beijing. He was known to be a friend of Fidel Castro.[PARAGRAPH:1]In retirement, Trudeau rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press. However, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. His opposition was a critical factor leading to the defeat of the two proposals. He also spoke out against Jacques Parizeau and the Parti Quebecois with less effect. In his final years, Trudeau commanded respect in English Canada, but was regarded with suspicion in Quebec due to his role in the 1982 constitutional deal which was seen to have excluded the province. Trudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the Club of Rome.</string>

The sisters were known as Trung Trac and Trung Nhi and were born during the thousand-year Chinese occupation of Vietnam. The dates of their birth are unknown, but Trrung Trac was older than Trung Nhi. The exact date of their death is unknown but they both died in the year AD 43.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Trung sisters were born in a rural Vietnamese village, into a military family. Their father was a prefect of Me Linh, therefore the sisters grew up in a house well-versed in the martial arts. They also witnessed the cruel treatment of the Viets by their Chinese overlords. The Trung sisters spent much time studying the art of warfare, as well as learning fighting skills.[PARAGRAPH:1]In AD 39 Trung Trac and Trung Nhi, after successfully repelling a small Chinese unit from their village, assembled a large army, consisting mostly of women. Within months, they had taken back many (about 65) citadels from the Chinese, and had liberated much of Vietnam. They became queens of the country, and managed to resist all Chinese attacks on Vietnam for over two years.[PARAGRAPH:1]Their revolution was short lived however, as the Chinese gathered a huge expeditionary army to crush the native fighters. Legend has it that the Chinese army did this by going into battle unclothed. The enemy's brazenness so shamed the Vietnamese female warriors that they fled the battle scene, leaving the weakened forces easily defeated by the Chinese.[PARAGRAPH:1]Despite the many heroic efforts, the Trung sisters realised that they had been defeated and that to fight further would mean death at the hands of the Chinese. Therefore to protect their honour, and to elude ridicule, the two queens committed suicide by drowning themselves in the Hat River (AD 43).[PARAGRAPH:1]The Trung Sisters are highly revered in Vietnam, as they led the first resistance movement against the occupying Chinese after 247 years of domination. Many temples are dedicated to them, and a yearly holiday, occurring in February, to commemorate their deaths is observed by many Vietnamese. A district in Hanoi is named after them. In addition, numerous large streets in major cities are named after them. They are often depicted riding on elephants into battle.  </string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_TUDJMAN_PEDIA">[H1]Franjo Tudjman[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]1st President of Croatia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1922 - 1999 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Franjo Tudjman was born in Veliko Trgovice, a village in the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia, then a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  During WWII Tudjman, together with his brother Stjepan, fought on the side of the Partisans. His brother was killed in 1943, but Franjo had better luck, meeting his future wife Ankica. Shortly after the end of the war his father Stjepan, who was an important member of the Croatian Peasant Party, killed his wife and then himself, according to the police finding. After the war's end Tudjman worked in the Ministry of Defence in Belgrade, attending military academy in 1957. Tudjman left active army service in 1961 to found the Institut za historiju radnickoga pokreta Hrvatske (\"Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers' Movement\"), and remained its director until 1967.Apart from his book on guerrilla warfare, Tudjman wrote a series of articles criticizing the Yugoslav Socialist establishment, and was subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important book from that period was Velike ideje i Mali narodi  (\"Great ideas and small nations\"), a monograph on political history that collided with central dogmas of Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the interconnectedness of the national and social elements in the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during WWII).  In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for subversive activities during the Croatian Spring. According to Tudjman's own testimony, Yugoslav President Marshal Josip Broz Tito personally intervened to recommend the court be lenient in his case, sparing him a far longer sentence. The authorities of SR Croatia additionally intended to prosecute Tudjman for a sentence of 1520 years imprisonment and hard labor (\"robija\") on charges of espionage, which was averted by President Tito's intervention. According to Tudjman, he and Tito were personal friends.  The Croatian Spring was a national movement that was actually set in motion by Josip Broz Tito and Croatian party chairman Vladimir Bakaric in the climate of growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but it soon grew into mass nationalist-based manifestation of dissatisfaction with the position of Croatia within Yugoslavia, and threatened the party's political monopoly.  As a result, the movement was suppressed by Tito, who used the military and the police to put a stop to what he saw as separatism and a threat to the party's influence. Bakaric quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and sided with the Yugoslav president. However, Tito took the protesters' demands into consideration, and in 1974 the new Yugoslav constitution granted the majority of the demands sought by the Croatian Spring.  Tudjman's role in 1971 was that of a dissident but also a head of a new-born Croatian Mafia who questioned what he saw as the cornerstones of modern Serbian nationalism - the number of victims of the Jasenovac concentration camp, as well as the role of centralism in Yugoslavia and the ideology of unitary \"Yugoslavism.\" Tudjman felt that what was originally a Croatian Romantic pan-Slavic idea from the 19th century had mutated into the front for what he claimed was a pan-Serbian drive for domination over non-Serb people.  On other topics like Communism and one-party monopoly, Tudjman remained mostly within the framework of Communist ideology. His sentence was commuted by Tito's government and Tudjman was released after nine months.  Tudjman was trialed again in 1981 for having spread \"enemy propaganda\", while giving an interview to the Swedish TV on the position of Croats in Yugoslavia and was sentenced to three years of prison, but again he only served a portion (this time eleven months).Internal tensions that had broken up the Communist party of Yugoslavia prompted the governments of federal Republics to call for the first free multiparty elections after 1945.  Tudjman's connections with Croatian diaspora (he travelled a few times to Canada and the USA after 1987) proved to be crucial when he founded Croatian Democratic Union (\"Hrvatska demokratska zajednica\" or HDZ, as it became known after its acronym) in 1989  a party that was to stay in power until 2000, and which cannot be classified along criteria dominant in stable societies.  Essentially, this was a nationalist Croatian movement that affirmed Croatian values based on Catholicism blended with historical and cultural traditions generally suppressed in Communist Yugoslavia. The aim was to gain national independence and to establish a Croatian nation-state. His party triumphed and got around 60% seats in the Croatian Parliament. After a few constitutional changes, which included his refusal to endorse the Serbs' place in the Croat constitution inflamed Serb opinion in Croatia, resulting in many Serbs being purged from their jobs in the police, security forces, the media and factories.  Tudjman was elected to the position of President of Croatia.  Since the split among Communists in Yugoslavia on a national basis was already a fact at that time (according to prevalent opinion, that was primarily Serbian leader Slobodan Miloevic's responsibility), it was inevitable that the conflict should continue after the democratic elections that brought to power non-Communists in Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Communists held their position in Serbia and Montenegro. For the tensions and wars that ensued, one should see history of Croatia and history of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The importance of Tudjman's leadership was seen at crucial junctures of Croatia's history: the all-out war against combined forces of Yugoslav Army and Serbian irredentist rebels, war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Operation Storm and the Dayton peace agreement. For instance: Tudjman's strategy of stalling the Yugoslav Army in 1991 by signing frequent cease fires intermediated by foreign diplomats was efficient  when the first cease fire was signed, the emerging Croatian Army had seven brigades; the last, twentieth cease fire the Croats had met with 64 brigades.  Unlike Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic, Tudjman managed to promote his equally rampant nationalism without attracting widespread condemnation. He achieved this by currying favour with the West by creating the impression that he was creating multi-party democracy at home. Yet, he has been accused that his domestic policy is quite non-democratic.  Even during his presidency there were circles in society who claimed that Mr Tudjman's rule was autocratic and that he showed little sensitivity to criticism.

 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_TUSHRATTA_PEDIA">[H1]Tushratta[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Mitanni[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 14th Century BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]At the beginning of his reign, the Hittite King Suppiluliuma I, reconquered Kizzuwatna, then invaded the western part of the Euphrates valley and conquered the Amurru and Nuhae in Hanigalbat. According to the Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty, Suppiluliuma had made a treaty with Artatama, a rival of Tushratta. Nothing is known of Artatama's previous life or connection, if any, to the royal family. The document calls him king of the Hurrians, while Tushratta is given the title of \"King of Mitanni\", which must have disagreed with Tushratta. Suppiluliuma started to plunder the lands of the west bank of the Euphrates river and he annexed Mount Lebanon. Tushratta threatened to raid beyond the Euphrates if even a single lamb or kid was stolen.Suppiluliuma then recounts how the land of Isuwa on the upper Euphrates had seceded in the time of his grandfather. Attempts to conquer it failed. In the time of his father, other cities rebelled. Suppiluliumas claims to have defeated them, but the survivors fled to the territory of Isuwa that must have been part of Tushratta's realm. A clause to return fugitives was part of many treaties made at the time, so possibly the harbouring of fugitives by Isuwa formed the pretext for the Hittite invasion. A Hittite army crossed the border, entered Isuwa and returned the fugitives (or deserters or exile governments) to Hittite rule. \"I freed the lands which I captured; they dwelt in their places. All the people whom I released rejoined their peoples and Hatti incorporated their territories,\" Suppiluliuma later boasted.  The Hittite army then marched through various districts towards the Mitanni capital of Washshukanni. Suppiluliumas claims to have plundered the district and to have brought loot, captives, cattle, sheep and horses back to Hatti. He also claims that Tushratta fled, but obviously he failed to capture the capital. While the campaign weakened Tushratta's kingdom, he still held onto his throne.In a second campaign, the Hittites again crossed the Euphrates and subdued Halab, Mukish, Niya, Arahati, Apina, and Qatna  as well as some cities whose names have not been preserved. Charioteers are mentioned among the booty from Arahati, who were brought to Hatti together with all their possessions. While it was common practice to incorporate enemy soldiers in the army, this might point to a Hittite attempt to counter the most potent weapon of the Mitanni, the war-chariots, by building up or strengthening their own chariot forces.  Tushratta had possibly suspected Hittite intentions on his kingdom, for the Amarna letters include several tablets from Tushratta concerning the marriage of his daughter Tadukhipa with Akhenaten, explicitly to solidify an alliance with the Egyptian kingdom. However, when Suppiluliumas invaded his kingdom, the Egyptians failed to respond in timeperhaps because of the sudden death of Akhenaten, and the resulting struggle for control of the Egyptian throne.  According to a treaty later made between Suppiluliuma and Tushratta's brother Shattiwaza, after a third devastating Hittite raid led to the fall of Carchemish, Tushratta was assassinated by a group led by one of his sons. A time of civil war followed which came to an end when Suppiluliuma placed Shattiwaza on the Mitannian throne.</string>

Prior to that she was a successful businesswoman in the gas industry and became one of the wealthiest people in Ukraine. Before becoming Ukraine's first female prime minister, she was considered the most significant ally of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko and had a very high profile during the 2004 presidential election. She was also one of the key leaders of the Orange Revolution inspired by those elections, which eventually brought Yushchenko to power. In this period, some Western media publications dubbed her \"Joan of Arc of the Orange Revolution\".[PARAGRAPH:1]Tymoshenko experienced a rise in power under the Soviet system, but it was after the demise of the Soviet Union that she rose to particular prominence, directing several energy-related companies and acquiring a significant fortune between 1990 and 1998. During privatisation in Ukraine, which mirrored that in Russia in terms of corruption and mismanagement, she became one of the wealthiest oligarchs in Ukraine, exporting metals. From 1995 to 1997, Tymoshenko was the president of the United Energy Systems of Ukraine, a privately owned middleman company which became the main importer of Russian natural gas in 1996. During that time she was nicknamed \"gas princess\" in the light of accusations she has been reselling enormous quantities of stolen Russian gas and avoiding taxation of those deals. [PARAGRAPH:1]Yulia Tymoshenko made a move into politics in 1996, and was elected to the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) from the Kirovohrad oblast, winning a record 92.3% of the vote in her constituency. She was re-elected in 1998 and 2002. In 1998, she became the Chair of the Budget Committee of Verkhovna Rada. [PARAGRAPH:1]Despite this questionable past, her transition from oligarch to reformer was believed by many to be both genuine and effective. As energy Deputy Prime Minister, she virtually ended many corrupt arrangements in the energy sector. Under her stewardship, Ukraine's revenue collections from the electricity industry grew by several thousand per cent. She scrapped the practice of barter in the electricity market, requiring industrial customers to pay for their electricity in cash. She also terminated exemptions for many organizations which excluded them from having their power disconnected. Her reforms meant that the government had sufficient funds to pay civil servants and increase salaries. [PARAGRAPH:1]However, several months into her government, a failure to deliver on the promise of reform after the Orange Revolution began to damage Tymoshenko's administration. On 8 September 2005, after the resignation of several senior officials including the Head of the Security and Defence Council Petro Poroshenko and Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Tomenko, Yulia Tymoshenko's government was dismissed by President Victor Yuschenko. It is expected that a current Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc will enter the opposition and pave the way for a run for President of Ukraine by Tymoshenko in 2009, an election many analysts say she could easily win.</string>

 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_VARGAS_PEDIA">[H1]Getúlio Dornelles Vargas[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President and Dictator of Brazil[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1882 - 1954[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Vargas was a gaúcho, from the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, deeply divided in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by bloody civil war, from which emerged a centralist political system, influenced by positivism. Vargas helped to unite two of his state's most important political clans, becoming President of Rio Grande do Sul, then Minister of Finance in the federal government. He was already a seasoned politician, cautious, conciliatory, and with a strong dislike of conflict and confrontation, when he became President of Brazil, following the revolution of 3 October 1930. Vargas now drew on the centralizing tradition of his native state, supported by military leaders and industrialists, to weld  the loose federation of the \"Old Republic\" (1889  30) into a centralized state, with a stronger federal army, a stronger civil service and greatly enlarged social and economic powers and responsibilities. He confronted São Paulo in a civil war in 1932, defused other political opposition, from left and right, and pushed through political and social change under the corporatist constitution of the Estado Novo, 1937 to 1945.In this process, he sought to break Brazil's economic dependence, however lucrative, on coffee and a handful of other primary products. He introduced measures for industrialization, including state control of the new steel industry, and sought to create a new industrial working class under corporatist controls, but protected, at least in law, by a detailed system of social and labour legislation, well in advance of its time. After Brazil entered the Second World War on the Allies' side, there was increased opposition to Vargas's corporatism, which he recognized by creating two political parties, the PTB (the Brazilian Labour Party), and the PSD (the Social Democratic Party), the first drawing on working-class support through the Ministry of Labour, the second largely on rural clientelism. He especially cultivated the urban working class and promised free elections, but was forced out of office in 1945 by united civilian and military opposition.Vargas was elected as President in 1950 and committed himself to a programme of trabalhismo, namely, concerned with and for organized labour. This introduced, then increased, a minimum wage, offered wider social reforms, and sought to protect the national economy from what was perceived as an illegitimate degree of foreign intervention. Vargas's enemies on the right, in alliance with some leaders of the armed forces, partly inspired by Cold War ideology, accused him of \"populism\" and wishing to follow a political trajectory similar to that of Perón in Argentina. Under extreme pressure, Vargas shot himself on 24 August 1954.Vargas remains an enigmatic figure, a supreme conciliatory politician, who died in political conflict, a social reformer, who imposed authoritarian controls, but was democratically elected with passionate popular support. The political tradition he introduced was inherited by President Kubitschek (1956  61), especially in promoting industrialization and infrastructure investment. The coup of 1964 and the subsequent military-backed regime (1964  85) were largely a reaction to Vargas and his policies. The key issues raised in his second period of government are still central to Brazilian political debate.</string>

It is not stated in any of the records, how Vijayalaya defeated to capture Thanjavur. During the 8th century Tanjore was ruled by a family of chiefs known as the Mutharaiyars. Historians have suggested that they may have belonged to the Pandya clan. At this time there was a great struggle going on between the Pallavas and the Pandyas for the political supremacy of South India. In this disturbed state of affairs, Vijayalaya seems to have found a good opportunity to defeat the Muttaraiyan chiefs, and make himself the ruler of Thanjavur and the surrounding Chola country.  Vijayala Chola conquered Thanjavur from Elango Mutharayar who was the final ruler of Mutharaiyar dynasty. It is said that in the year A.D.852 Vijayalaya Chola waged war with the Muttaraiyar king Sattan Paliyilli (A.D.826-852) in the neighbouring east, and captured his territory of Thanjavur. While Vijayalaya Chola was a Pallava feudatory, the Muttaraiyan chief was a Pandya feudatory. Making use of the opportunity during a war between Pandyas and Pallavas, Vijayalaya rose out of obscurity and captured Thanjavur. As a result of this defeat of Muttarayar chiefs, Cholas became so powerful that Pallavas were also wiped out from Thanjavore region at a later stage.After Vijayalayas capture of Thanjavur, the Pandya king Varagunavarman II (c. 862 C.E.  885 C.E.) became a subordinate ally of the Pallava Nandivarman III  (c. 846 C.E.  869 C.E.). Nandhivarman wished to curtail the growing influence of Chola power under Vijayalaya and called upon the Varagunavarman to help suppress Vijayalaya. Varaguna led an expedition into the Chola country. The Pandyan army reached the north bank of the Kaveri near Thanjavur and for a while the Chola revival looked short lived. Vijayalaya, by this time a veteran of many battles, was aging and was an invalid. The crown prince Aditya I took control of the army in the defence of the Chola kingdom. Vijayalaya was succeeded after his death c 871 C.E. by his son Aditya I.</string>

His post-mortem moniker of Tepes (Impaler) originated in his preferred method for executing his opponents,impalement as popularized by medieval Transylvanian pamphlets. In Turkish, he was known as \"Kazikli Bey\" which means \"Impaler Prince\". Vlad was referred to as Dracula in a number of documents of his times, mainly the Transylvanian Saxon pamphlets and The Annals of Jan lugosz.[PARAGRAPH:1]He seems to have led the life of all the other princes of Wallachia, spending most of his time at the court of Targoviste, occasionally in other important cities, such as Bucharest , drafting laws, meeting foreign envoys and presiding over important judicial trials. He probably made public appearances on relevant occasions, such as religious holidays and major fairs.[PARAGRAPH:1]Romanian oral tradition provides another important source for the life of Vlad the Impaler: legends and tales concerning the Impaler have remained a part of folklore among the Romanian peasantry. These tales have been passed down from generation to generation for five hundred years. Through constant retelling they have become somewhat garbled and confused and they have gradually been forgotten in later years. However, they still provide valuable information about Dracula and his relationship with his people. Many of the tales contained in the pamphlets are also found in the oral tradition, though with a somewhat different emphasis. Among the Romanian peasantry, Vlad Tepes was remembered as a just prince who defended his people from foreign aggression, whether those foreigners were Turkish invaders or German merchants. He is also remembered as a champion of the common man against the oppression of the boyars.[PARAGRAPH:1]Outside Romanian folklore the reputation of Vlad Tepes is considerably darker. Vlad III Tepes has been characterized by some as exceedingly cruel. Impalement was Tepes's preferred method of torture and execution. His method of torture was a horse attached to each of the victim's legs as a sharpened stake was gradually forced into the body. The end of the stake was usually oiled, and care was taken that the stake not be too sharp; else the victim might die too rapidly from shock. Normally the stake was inserted into the body through the anus and was often forced through the body until it emerged from the mouth. However, there were many instances where victims were impaled through other bodily orifices or through the abdomen or chest. Infants were sometimes impaled on the stake forced through their mother's chests. The records indicate that victims were sometimes impaled so that they hung upside down on the stake.[PARAGRAPH:1]There are several variants of Vlad III the Impaler's death. Some sources say he was killed in battle against the Ottoman near Bucharest in December of 1476. Others say he was assassinated by disloyal Wallachian boyars just as he was about to sweep the Turks from the field or during a hunt. Other accounts have Vlad falling in defeat, surrounded by the bodies of his loyal Moldavian bodyguards (the troops loaned by Prince Stephen remained with Vlad after Stephen Báthory returned to his country). Still other reports claim that Vlad, at the moment of victory, was struck down by one of his own men. There are accounts that Vlad's body was decapitated by the Turks and his head was sent to Istanbul and preserved in honey, where the sultan had it displayed on a stake as proof that Kazikli Bey was finally dead.</string>

After graduating from vocational school, he worked as a car mechanic at a machine center from 1961 to 1965. He served in the army for two years, rose to the rank of corporal, and in 1967 was employed in the Gdansk shipyards as an electrician. In 1969 he married Danuta Golos and they have eight children.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the clash in December 1970 between the workers and the government, he was one of the leaders of the shipyard workers and was briefly detained. In 1976, however, as a result of his activities as a shop steward, he was fired and had to earn his living by taking temporary jobs.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1978 with other activists he began to organise free non-communist trade unions and took part in many actions on the sea coast. He was kept under surveillance by the state security service and frequently detained.[PARAGRAPH:1]In August 1980 he led the Gdansk shipyard strike which gave rise to a wave of strikes over much of the country with Walesa seen as the leader. The primary demands were for workers' rights. The authorities were forced to capitulate and to negotiate with Walesa the Gdansk Agreement of August 31, 1980, which gave the workers the right to strike and to organise their own independent union.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Catholic Church supported the movement, and in January 1981 Walesa was cordially received by Pope John Paul II in the Vatican. Walesa himself has always regarded his Catholicism as a source of strength and inspiration. In the years 1980-81 Walesa travelled to Italy, Japan, Sweden, France and Switzerland as guest of the International Labour Organisation. In September 1981 he was elected Solidarity Chairman at the First National Solidarity Congress in Gdansk.[PARAGRAPH:1]The country's brief enjoyment of relative freedom ended in December 1981, when General Jaruzelski, fearing Soviet armed intervention among other considerations, imposed martial law, \"suspended\" Solidarity, arrested many of its leaders, and interned Walesa in a country house in a remote spot.[PARAGRAPH:1]In November 1982 Walesa was released and reinstated at the Gdansk shipyards. Although kept under surveillance, he managed to maintain lively contact with Solidarity leaders in the underground. While martial law was lifted in July 1983, many of the restrictions were continued in civil code. In October 1983 the announcement of Walesa's Nobel prize raised the spirits of the underground movement, but the award was attacked by the government press.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Jaruzelski regime became even more unpopular as economic conditions worsened, and it was finally forced to negotiate with Walesa and his Solidarity colleagues. The result was the holding of parliamentary elections which, although limited, led to the establishment of a non-communist government. Under Mikhail Gorbachev the Soviet Union was no longer prepared to use military force to keep communist parties in satellite states in power.[PARAGRAPH:1]Walesa, now head of the revived Solidarity labour union, began a series of meetings with world leaders.[PARAGRAPH:1]In April 1990 at Solidarity's second national congress, Walesa was elected chairman with 77.5% of the votes. In December 1990 in a general ballot he was elected President of the Republic of Poland. He served until defeated in the election of November 1995.[PARAGRAPH:1]Walesa has been granted many honorary degrees from universities, including Harvard University and the University of Paris.

He was a younger, paternal half-brother to Margarethe of Bohemia and Boislava of Bohemia. His half-sisters were respectively the first Queen consort of Valdemar II of Denmark and the first wife of Henry I, Count of Ortenburg. His sister Judith of Bohemia was married to Bernhard von Spanheim, Duke of Carinthia.His sister Anna of Bohemia was married to Henry II the Pious, Duke of Wroclaw. His sister Agnes of Bohemia was Mother Superior of the Franciscan Poor Clares nuns of Prague. In 1989, Agnes was canonized as a saint by Pope John Paul II.  On 6 February 1228, Wenceslaus was crowned as co-ruler of the Kingdom of Bohemia with his father. On 15 December 1230, Ottokar died and Wenceslaus succeeded him as the senior King of Bohemia.His early reign was preoccupied by the threat to Bohemia posed by Frederick II, Duke of Austria. The expansionism of Frederick caused the concern and protestation of several other rulers. In 1236, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor was involved in a war against the Lombard League. The Emperor demanded Wenceslaus and other rulers of the Holy Roman Empire  to lend him part of their own troops for his war effort. Wenceslaus led a group of princes who expressed their reluctance to divert any troops from the defense of their own territories, citing fear of invasion from the Duchy of Austria. They requested imperial intervention in the situation.  In June, 1236, the Emperor imposed an imperial ban on the Duke of Austria. Troops dispatched against the Duke, forced him to flee Vienna for Wiener Neustadt. He would continue to rule a rump state for the following year. The Emperor declared direct imperial rule in both Austria and the Duchy of Styria, also held by the fleeing Duke. Ekbert von Andechs-Meranien, former Bishop of Bamberg was installed as governor in the two Duchies.  Ekbert would govern from February to his death on 5 June 1237. Wenceslaus was hardly pleased with this apparent expansion of direct imperial authority close to his borders. Wenceslaus and Duke Frederick formed an alliance against the Emperor. Frederick the Emperor chose to lift the ban in 1237 rather than maintain another open front. Wenceslaus managed to negotiate the expansion of Bohemia north of the Danube, annexing territories offered by Duke Frederick in order of forming and maintaining their alliance.  Wenceslaus and Frederick also found another ally in the person of Otto II Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria. In June, 1239, Wenceslaus and Otto left the Reichstag at Eger, abandoning the service of excommunicated Emperor Frederick II. Despite their intent to elect an antiking no such election would take place until 1246. In 1246, Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia was elected King of Germany in opposition to Emperor Frederick II and Conrad IV of Germany.In 1241 Wenceslaus successfully repelled a raid on Bohemia by forces serving under Batu Khan and Subutai of the Mongol Empire as part of the Mongol invasion of Europe. The Mongols did not send their main army to the Kingdom of Poland, Bohemia and Silesia and only Moravia suffered devastation at their hands. The raids into these four areas were led by Baidar, Kadan and Orda Khan with a force of around 20,000 Mongols. Following the Mongol victory at the Battle of Legnica, Wenceslaus fell back to gather reinforcements from Thuringia and Saxony, but was overtaken by the Mongol vanguard at Klodzko. However, the Bohemian cavalry easily fended off the Mongol detachment. As Baidar and Kadan's orders had been to serve as a diversion, they turned away from Bohemia and Poland and went southward to join Batu and Subutai, who had crushed the Hungarians at the Battle of Mohi.  When Subutai heard in 1242 that Grand Khan Ögedei had died the previous year, the Mongol army retreated eastward, because Subutai had three princes of the blood in his command and Genghis Khan had made clear that all descendants of the Khagan (Grand Khan) should return to the Mongol capital of Karakorum for the kurultai which would elect the next Khagan. The Polish people, unaware of the reason why the Mongols left so suddenly, simply assumed that they had been defeated in battle.On 15 June 1246, Frederick II of Austria was killed in a battle against Béla IV of Hungary. The battle took place by the river Leitha. He was childless and had never designated an heir.  The matter of his succession would result in years of disputes among various heirs. Wenceslaus' foreign policy became focused on acquiring Austria for the Premyslid dynasty. Meanwhile Emperor Frederick II managed to once again place Austria under direct imperial rule. However imperial governor Otto von Eberstein had to content with an Austrian rebellion, preventing immediate benefits from the annexation of the Duchy.  The Privilegium Minus, the document which had elevated Austria to a Duchy on 17 September 1156, allowed for the female line of the House of Babenberg to succeed to the throne. Gertrude, Duchess of Austria, niece of the late Frederick II, thus was able to claim the Duchy in her own right. Wenceslaus arranged for her marriage to his eldest son, Vladislaus, Margrave of Moravia. Vladislaus was declared a jure uxoris Duke of Austria and managed to secure the support of part of the Austrian nobility. On 3 January 1247, Vladislaus died suddenly and the initial plan of Wenceslaus was negated. Gertrude continued her claim and proceeded to marry Herman VI, Margrave of Baden.In 1248, Wenceslaus had to deal with a rebellion of the Bohemian nobility, led by his own son Ottokar II. Ottokar had been enticed by discontented nobles to lead the rebellion, during which he received the nickname \"the younger King\" (mladí král). Wenceslaus managed to defeat the rebels and imprisoned his son.  Ottokar II held the title of King of Bohemia from 31 July 1248 to November, 1249.  By the end of 1250, both the Emperor and Herman VI were deceased. The latter having never been accepted by the Austrian nobles. Gertrude and their only son Frederick I, Margrave of Baden continued their claim. Wenceslaus led a successful invasion of Austria, completed by 1251.  Wenceslaus released Ottokar II and named him margrave of Moravia. Wenceslaus had Ottokar proclaimed Duke of Austria and acclaimed by the nobility. In order to secure dynastic rights to Austria, Wenceslaus had another female Babenberg proclaimed Duchess and betrothed to his son. Margaret, Duchess of Austria was a sister of Duke Frederick II and an aunt of Gertrude. She was also the widow of Henry (VII) of Germany who had died in 1242. However, Margaret was much older than Ottokar. Their marriage took place on 11 February 1252.  Wenceslaus did not enjoy his victory for long. He died on 23 September 1253 and Ottokar II succeeded him.</string>

Until this time his campaign of lectures had been carried out under the auspices of the Political Education Movement (PEM) a branch of the Teachers Education and Cultural Association, a group which had been founded in the 1940s as an alternative to the official teachers' union. The PNM's first document was its constitution. Unlike the other political parties of the time, the PNM was a highly organized, hierarchical body. Its second document was The People's Charter' in which the party strove to separate itself from the transitory political assemblages which had thus far been the norm in Trinidadian politics.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the post-war mood of decolonisation, the decision was made to create an independent West Indies Federation out of the British West Indies. British Guiana (now Guyana) and British Honduras (now Belize) chose to opt out of the Federation, leaving Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago as the dominant players. Most political parties in the various territories aligned themselves into one of two Federal political parties - the West Indies Federal Labour Party (led by Norman Manley) and the Democratic Labour Party (led by Manley's cousin, Sir Alexander Bustamante). The PNM affiliated with the former, while several of opposition parties (the People's Democratic Party, the Trinidad Labour Party and the Party of Political Progress Groups) aligned themselves with the DLP, and soon merged to form the Democratic Labour Party of Trinidad and Tobago. The 1961 elections gave the PNM 57% of the votes and 20 of the 30 seats. This two-thirds majority allowed them to draft the Independence Constitution without input from the DLP. Although supported by the Colonial Office, independence was blocked by the DLP, until Williams was able to make a deal with DLP leader Rudranath Capildeo which strengthened the rights of the minority party and expanded the number of Opposition Senators. With Capildeo's assent, Trinidad and Tobago became independent on August 31, 1962.[PARAGRAPH:1] Between 1968 and 1970 the Black Power movement gained strength in Trinidad and Tobago. The leadership of the movement developed within the Guild of Undergraduates at the St. Augustine Campus of the University of the West Indies. Led by Geddes Granger, the National Joint Action Committee joined up with trade unionists led by George Weekes of the Oilfields Workers' Trade Union and Basdeo Panday, then a young trade union lawyer and activist. The Black Power Revolution got started during the 1970 Carnival. In response to the challenge, Williams countered with a broadcast entitled I am for Black Power. He introduced a 5% levy to fund unemployment reduction and established the first locally-owned commercial bank. However, this intervention had little impact on the protests.[PARAGRAPH:1] Eric Williams was a descendant from a family (the de Boissiere family), that made its fortune trading African slaves illegally, after slave trading had been abolished in 1807. Williams specialised in the study of the abolition of the slave trade. In 1944 his book Capitalism and Slavery argued that the British abolition of their Atlantic slave trade in 1807 was motivated primarily by economics -- rather than by altruism or humanitarianism. By extension, so was the emancipation of the slaves and the fight against the trading in slaves by other nations. As industrial capitalism and wage labor began to expand, eliminating the competition from slavery became economically advantageous. Before Williams the historiography of this issue had been dominated by (mainly) British writers who generally were prone to depict Britain's actions as unimpeachable.[PARAGRAPH:1] Eric Williams sent one of 73 Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages to NASA for the historic first lunar landing in 1969. The message still rests on the lunar surface today. Williams wrote, in part, \"It is our earnest hope for mankind that while we gain the moon, we shall not lose the world.\"</string>

He married a Kuyuidika woman, the daughter of Old Winnemucca, and thus was a Paiute himself by tribal rules.  His father-in-law honored him by giving him his own name. Winnemucca or Wuna Mucca has been translated as \"The Giver of Spiritual Gifts.\"  This name is part-English and part-Paiute. Winnemucca the Younger became war chief of the Kuyuidika (bird eaters), a Northern Paiute band.Winnemucca the Younger became war chief of the Kuyuidika.  Unlike his father-in-law, Winnemucca the Older, he was distrustful of white settlers.  His role in Northern Paiute politics is difficult to determine and somewhat controversial. He is primarily known through the writings of his daughter, Sarah Winnemucca. She downplayed his Shoshoni roots and connections to distinguish her father and her people as peaceful and to protect them from the prejudice many settlers held against the more warlike \"Snake Indians.\" Sarah exaggerated his influence over the Paiute people, stating that he was the absolute chief of all the Paiute tribes. Due in large part to her role as a translator, this viewpoint was shared by contemporary Oregonians Modern historians and ethnologists view him more as a \"first among equals,\" with considerable influence over the bands in the Pyramid Lake region.  He was a leading proponent of the Pyramid Lake War of 1860.  However, when the Paviotso Confederacy was first forming at the Ochoco Council of 1851, the Paiute people had been more inclined to listen to his father-in-law, (Old) Chief One Moccasin, and keep the peace, than to follow Bad Face's counsel to join the other Shoshone and Northern Ute warriors in the war effort. Later, Bad Face did lead several Paiute units into active fighting, where they would be misidentified as Snake warriors.During the winter of 1872-1873, over his daughter's objections, Bad Face refused to go and farm for a living on the Malheur Reservation, where she was staying at the time, saying he might starve there. His hideout was at the base of Steens Mountain, near the Reuben and Dolly Kiger Ranch in what is now Harney County, Oregon. By 1873, settlers and the government in Oregon had come to worry that the Paiute people under Bad Face might be organizing to join with the more war-inclined Shoshone people under Has No Horse, and that they might either collaborate or unite with their old enemies, the Modoc people, under John Schonchin and Modicus, in what became the Modoc War.  On April 11, 1873, the Modoc War ended. By 1874, \"Winnemucca, the Chief of the Paiutes\", eight braves, Sarah, and another of his daughters would grace the stage of the Metropolitan Theater with a series of skits on Indian life, which they performed for five years. As of April 1875, Bad Face was visiting and leaving the Malheur Reservation as he pleased, while that agency was under the comparatively decent Indian agent Samuel Parrish. Parrish had built irrigation canals and a school for the reservation. He had also broadened the limits of the reservation to secure better farmland for the reservation Shoshoni, without any permission to do so, including Pony Blanket's cultivated land and the Shoshoni's traditional hot springs bath. This caused conflict with powerful local settlers who also wanted that land, including ranchers Henry Miller and Pete French, and so a successful campaign to oust Parrish from the agency ensued.  In early April 1875, Bad Face, Sarah Winnemucca, and Pony Blanket attempted unsuccessfully to persuade officers at Fort Harney to help reinstate Parrish, but William V. Rinehart and some of the other wealthy anonymous campaigners fought back, falsely accusing officers at Fort Harney, Fort McDermitt, and Fort Bidwell of supplying food to Shoshoni who refused to stay on the Malheur Reservation empowering them to stay away. Rinehart was the sworn enemy of both the Shoshoni and Paiute, preferring absolute authority and extermination of indigenous people, where possible. Parrish was ultimately replaced by Rinehart, who arrived at the Malheur Reservation on June 28, 1876, just three days after Custer's fall at Little Bighorn. He began defrauding, starving, and abusing both reservation and non-reservation native people immediately.Following successful political pressure from northeastern Oregon settlers upon the Congress, to overturn President Ulysses S. Grant's pact to let the Nez Perce stay in Wallowa, on June 13, 1877 Nez Perce leader Chief Joseph went on the warpath. He killed four white men, after refusing to move some 500 of his people off of their high mountain meadow in the Wallowa Valley to the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho, which was to have included Camas Prairie, but due to a \"clerical\" error, did not. The Paiutes, who had been leaving the Malheur Reservation to escape both Rinehart and starvation, returned en masse, knowing they would at least be safer at the reservation during wartime. Meanwhile Bad Face and some of his warriors journeyed to Boise City, where they dined as guests of honor with Governor Mason Brayman and assured him that Bad Face, Has No Horse, and their people had only peaceful intent. Still, neither would go onto the Malheur Reservation as Rinehart insisted and conditions continued to worsen. Two Shoshoni Snake dog soldiers came to the Malheur Reservation in March 1878 and threatened war as soon as there was grass. Idaho Governor Brayman wrote to US Senator W. J. McConnell on their behalf, agreeing that the Banattee Snakes at Fort Hall Reservation had \"ample justification\" for the methods they pursued, given the ongoing loss of their natural food supply, camas root, to the settlers hogs.  On June 16, 1878, the Salt Lake City Tribune reported that Laughing Hawk (Tambiago), imprisoned at the Idaho Territorial Penitentiary, had informed officials there that Buffalo Horn (Kotsotiala) was to meet with Bad Face and Has No Horse in the \"Juniper Mountains\" (Steens). That point was ignored by those officials. On May 27, 1878, after holding a council of war, a second Shoshoni uprising was launched in eastern Oregon with the killing of James Dempsey, a white gun dealer who lived in Harney Valley with a Shoshoni wife. He had purchased arms in October 1877 from the Mormons at Salt Lake City and then sold the weapons to the Bannock/Bannatte Robber Snakes, after having for over a year prior urged them to go to war. He then informed Idaho Governor Brayman that war was eminent. The uprising turned into the second Shoshoni War, which the Americans would title the Bannock War. On June 5, Sarah Winnemucca met with Pony Blanket (Egan), Left Hand, Dancer, and Three Coyotes at the Malheur Indian Agency and learned that the Snake Indians were being starved out of the Malheur reservation, that they could not buy clothes, and that Paiute horses were being shot. Three Coyotes reported the rape of an Indian girl and the confiscation of weapons and horses at the Fort Hall Reservation. They gathered money to send Sarah to Washington to tell President Rutherford B. Hayes of these problems. She left on June 9, 1878 and on that day Captain Reuben Bernard caught up with Black Buffalo and Old Bull near the Oregon-Idaho border, in the process of pulling down telegraph lines to shut off the war zone communications, and he seriously wounded both men. Before the last of the lines were pulled down, General Irvin McDowell got a message through to Bad Face and his son Natchez, asking them to come and help keep the peace with the hostile Snakes at the Malheur Reservation, which both men said they would do. In fact they planned to join the Snakes at war. On June 10, 1878, Congress declared war on the Western Shoshoni Nation.</string>

Wovoka means \"wood cutter\" in the Northern Paiute language. [PARAGRAPH:1]Wovoka was born in the Smith Valley area southeast of Carson City, Nevada, around the year 1856. Wovoka was a distant relative to Sir. Jonathon Clay III. Wovoka's father may have been religious leader, variously known as \"Tavibo\" or \"Numu-Taibo\", whose teachings were similar to those of Wovoka. Regardless, Wovoka clearly had some training as a shaman. Wovoka's father died around the year 1870, and he was taken in by David Wilson, who was a rancher in the Yerington, Nevada area. Wovoka worked on the Wilson ranch, and used the name Jack Wilson in his dealings with whites. David Wilson was a devout Christian, and Wovoka learned Christian theology and bible stories while living with him. [PARAGRAPH:1]In his early adulthood, Wovoka gained a reputation as a powerful shaman. He was adept at magic tricks. One trick he often performed was being shot with a shotgun, which may have been similar to the bullet catch trick. Reports of this trick may have convinced the Lakota that their \"ghost shirts\" could stop bullets. Wovoka is also reported to have performed a levitation trick. [PARAGRAPH:1]In early 1889 Wovoka proclaimed that he had a prophetic vision during the solar eclipse on January 1 of that year. Wovoka vision entailed the resurrection of the Paiute dead and the removal of whites and their works from North America.To bring this vision to pass, Wovoka taught that they must live righteously and perform a round dance, known as the \"Ghost Dance\". Wovoka's teachings spread quickly among many Native American peoples, notably the Lakota. The Ghost Dance movement is perhaps best known for its role in the Wounded Knee Massacre. Wovoka died in Yerington on September 20, 1932 and is interred in the Paiute Cemetery in the town of Schurz, Nevada.</string>
 <string name="TXT_KEY_LEADER_YAGAN_PEDIA">[H1]Yagan[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Noongar Warrior [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c.1795 - 1833[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Yagan was a Noongar warrior who played a key part in early indigenous Australian resistance to European settlement and rule in the area of Perth, Western Australia. After he led a series of attacks in which white settlers were killed, a bounty was offered for his capture dead or alive, and he was shot dead by a young settler. Yagan's death has passed into Western Australian folklore as a symbol of the unjust and sometimes brutal treatment of the indigenous peoples of Australia by colonial settlers.[PARAGRAPH:1]Yagan is thought to have been born around 1795. His father was Midgegooroo, an elder of the Beeliar people; his mother was presumably one of Midgegooroo's two wives. Yagan was probably a Ballaroke in the Noongar classification. According to Green, he had a wife and two children, but most other sources state that he was unmarried and childless. Described as taller than average with an impressive burly physique, Yagan had a distinctive tribal tattoo on his right shoulder which identified him as \"a man of high degree in tribal law\". He was generally acknowledged to be the most physically powerful of his tribe. [PARAGRAPH:1]In June 1832 Yagan led a party of Aborigines in an attack on two labourers who were sowing a field of wheat alongside the Canning River near Kelmscott. One of the men escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died, possibly through infection of the spear wound. In response to this, Yagan was declared an outlaw. Yagan managed to avoid capture until early October 1832. He was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of a settler named Robert Lyon, who argued that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, and was therefore not a criminal but a prisoner of war, and was entitled to be treated as such. At the recommendation of John Septimus Roe, Yagan and his friends were instead exiled on Carnac Island at the Governor's pleasure, under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers. [PARAGRAPH:1]On 11 July 1833, two teenage brothers named William and James Keates were herding cattle along the Swan River north of Guildford when a group of Noongars approached. Being on friendly terms with Yagan, the Keates brothers suggested he remain with them to avoid arrest. Yagan remained with them all morning, during which time the boys decided to kill Yagan and claim the reward. William Keates tried once to shoot him but the gun stopped at half-cock; no further opportunity arose before they were rejoined by the other natives. When the natives attempted to depart, the Keates took their last opportunity. William Keates shot Yagan, and James shot another native, Heegan, in the act of throwing his spear. Both boys then ran for the river, but William was overtaken and speared to death. James escaped by swimming the river and returned shortly afterwards with a party of armed settlers from Bull's estate. [PARAGRAPH:1]Moore records that a party of soldiers passed by the area shortly after the incident, and speculates that they must have \"frightened the natives (I supposed) or they would have carried off the bodies\". When the party of settlers arrived, they found Yagan dead and Heegan dying. Heegan \"was groaning and his brains were partly out when the party came, and whether humanity or brutality, a man put a gun to his head and blew it to pieces.\" Yagan's head was then cut from his body, and his back was skinned to obtain his tribal markings as a trophy. The bodies were buried a short distance from where they had been killed.</string>

He was 1978 Australian of the Year.[PARAGRAPH:1]He was born at Melville Bay near Yirrkala on 1948 June 30, and is a member of the Gumatj clan of the Yolngu people. He attended Mission School at Yirrkala in his formative years, and moved to Brisbane to study at the Methodist Bible College for two years, returning to Gove in 1967. In the early 1960's with his father, the Gumatj clan leader Mungurrawuy, he entered the struggle for Land Rights, and helped draw up the Bark Petition at Yirrkala. He came to national attention in the late 1960's for his role in the landmark, but unsuccessful Gove Land Rights Case. This legal action was the first by Indigenous Australians to challenge mining companies' rights to exploit traditional lands. He became a prominent leader and strong voice on behalf of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and Australia, gaining respect and admiration from many. In 1969 he was elected to the Yirrkala town council. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1975 he joined the Northern Land Council (NLC), the authority appointed under the Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act 1976 to represent traditional Aboriginal landowners and Aboriginal people. He was chairman of the NLC from 1977-1980, an executive member until 1983 when he was re-elected as chairman, and has remained in that position to date (2004). He has led a number of negotiations with mining and government bodies. As chair of the NLC, he led the Gagudju people in negotiations with mining and government bodies. Not opposed to mining in principle, Yunupingu sees it as a way for Aboriginal people to escape the welfare trap if it is conducted on the traditional owners' terms. These include a fair distribution of the economic benefits and respect for the land and specific sacred sites. He said: 'We will continue to fight for the right to make our own decisions about our own land.'[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1978 he was awarded the Honour of Australian of the Year for his negotiations on the Ranger uranium mine agreement. He said the award 'would help him to shake off the image of ratbag and radical' and would give him 'greater strength as an individual and as a leader'. It was also a recognition for Aboriginal people as 'the indigenous people of this country who must share in its future'. In 1985, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his services to the Aboriginal community. Galarrwuy Yunupingu is one of 100 \"Australian Living National Treasures\" selected by the National Trust as leaders in society \"considered to have a great influence over our environment because of the standards and examples they set\".</string>

The Persians and Byzantines had been raging war for years, in a neverending cycle of the Byzantines ending with the look of defeat on their faces.  But Persia was soon to reach its doom, Khazaria.  The Roman emporor Heraclius made an alliance with the Khazars, of which several others follow, in order to finally defeat the Persians, as the Khazars had a powerful army.  The Khazars provided Heraclius with 40,000 men under the Khagan Bek Ziebel. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Ziebel participated in the advance to Persia, but then returned to lay siege on Tiflis, because he was presumably annoyed with Greek strategy.  But, this siege was unsuccessful, and he once again allied himself with Heraclius.  The Khazars under Ziebel broke throught the Caspian Gates and into Persia, and returned rich with plunder.  According to the description of Theophanes, Ziebel returned with \"plate and ornaments, the gold, the gems, and the silk, which had been used at the Imperial table, and, with his own hand, distributed rich jewels and earrings to his new allies.\"  The Khagan of Khazaria then arrived, and Ziebel and his troops all bowed down to the Khagan, and all advanced through Persia.  But as any empire rises to glory, it falls.  After Ziebel, the Khazar Empire fell, and was never in as much glory as it had been under Khagan Bek Ziebel.  </string>
